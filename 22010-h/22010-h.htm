</span><h2>Agaria</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1056">
<h3>1. Origin and subdivisions.</h3>
<p>Agaria.<a id="d0e1061src" href="#d0e1061" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A small Dravidian caste, who are an offshoot of the Gond tribe. The Agarias have adopted the profession of iron-smelting
and form a separate caste. They numbered 9500 persons in 1911 and live on the Maikal range in the Mandla, Raipur and Bil&#257;spur
Districts.

</p>
<p>The name probably signifies a worker with <i>&#257;g</i> or fire. An Agaria subcaste of Loh&#257;rs also exists, many of whom are quite probably Gonds, but they are not included in the
regular caste. Similar Dravidian castes of Agarias are to be found in M&#299;rz&#257;pur and Bengal. The Agarias are quite distinct
from the Agharia cultivating caste of the Uriya country. The Raipur Agarias still intermarry with the R&#257;wanbansi Gonds of
the District. The Agarias think that their caste has existed from the beginning of the world, and that the first Agaria made
the ploughshare with which the first bullocks furrowed the primeval soil. The caste has two endogamous divisions, the Patharia
and the Khuntia Agarias. The Patharias place a stone on the mouth of the bellows to fix them in the ground for smelting, while
the Khuntias use a peg. The two subcastes do not even take water from one another.

</p>
<p>Their exogamous sections have generally the same names as those of the Gonds, as Sonw&#257;ni, Dhurua, Tek&#257;m, Mark&#257;m, Uika, Purtai,
Marai, and others. A few names of Hindi origin are also found, as Ahindw&#257;r, Ranchirai and R&#257;thoria, which show that some Hindus
have probably been amalgamated with the caste. Ahindw&#257;r or Aindw&#257;r and Ranchirai mean a fish and a bird respectively in Hindi,
while R&#257;thoria is a <i>gotra</i> both of R&#257;jp&#363;ts and Telis. The Gond names are probably also those of animals, plants or other objects, but their meaning
has now generally been <a id="d0e1074"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1074">4</a>]</span>forgotten. Tek&#257;m or <i>teka</i> is a teak tree. Sonw&#257;ni is a sept found among several of the Dravidian tribes, and the lower Hindu castes. A person of the
Sonw&#257;ni sept is always chosen to perform the ceremony of purification and readmission into caste of persons temporarily excommunicated.
His duty often consists in pouring on such a person a little water in which gold has been placed to make it holy, and hence
the name is considered to mean Son&#257;p&#257;ni or gold-water. The Agarias do not know the meanings of their section names and therefore
have no totemistic observances. But they consider that all persons belonging to one <i>gotra</i> are descended from a common ancestor, and marriage within the <i>gotra</i> is therefore prohibited. As among the Gonds, first cousins are allowed to marry.

<div class="div2" id="d0e1085">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Marriage is usually adult. When the father of a boy wishes to arrange a marriage he sends emissaries to the father of the
girl. They open the proceedings by saying, &#8216;So-and-so has come to partake of your stale food.&#8217;<a id="d0e1090src" href="#d0e1090" class="noteref">2</a> If the father of the girl approves he gives his consent by saying, &#8216;He has come on foot, I receive him on my head.&#8217; The boy&#8217;s
father then repairs to the girl&#8217;s house, where he is respectfully received and his feet are washed. He is then asked to take
a drink of plain water, which is a humble method of offering him a meal. After this, presents for the girl are sent by a party
accompanied by tomtom players, and a date is fixed for the marriage, which, contrary to the usual Hindu rule, may take place
in the rains. The reason is perhaps because iron-smelting is not carried on during the rains and the Agarias therefore have
no work to do. A few days before the wedding the bride-price is paid, which consists of 5 seers each of <i>urad</i> and til and a sum of Rs. 4 to Rs. 12. The marriage is held on any Monday, Tuesday or Friday, no further trouble being taken
to select an auspicious day. In order that they may not forget the date fixed, the fathers of the parties each take a piece
of thread in which they tie a knot for every day intervening between the date when the marriage day is settled and the day
itself, and they then untie one knot for every day. Previous to the marriage all the village gods are propitiated by being
anointed with oil <a id="d0e1098"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1098">5</a>]</span>by the Baiga or village priest. The first clod of earth for the ovens is also dug by the Baiga, and received in her cloth
by the bride&#8217;s mother as a mark of respect. The usual procedure is adopted in the marriage. After the bridegroom&#8217;s arrival
his teeth are cleaned with tooth-sticks, and the bride&#8217;s sister tries to push <i>s&#257;j</i> leaves into his mouth, a proceeding which he prevents by holding his fan in front of his face. For doing this the girl is
given a small present. A <i>paili</i><a id="d0e1105src" href="#d0e1105" class="noteref">3</a> measure of rice is filled alternately by the bride and bridegroom twelve times, the other upsetting it each time after it
is filled. At the marriage feast, in addition to rice and pulse, mutton curry and cakes of <i>urad</i> pulse fried in oil are provided. <i>Urad</i> is held in great respect, and is always given as a food at ceremonial feasts and to honoured guests. The greater part of
the marriage ceremony is performed a second time at the bridegroom&#8217;s house. Finally, the decorations of the marriage-shed
and the palm-leaf crowns of the bride and bridegroom are thrown into a tank. The bride and bridegroom go into the water, and
each in turn hides a jar under water, which the other must find. They then bathe, change their clothes, and go back to the
bridegroom&#8217;s house, the bride carrying the jar filled with water on her head. The boy is furnished with a bow and arrows and
has to shoot at a stuffed deer over the girl&#8217;s shoulder. After each shot she gives him a little sugar, and if he does not
hit the deer in three shots he must pay 4 annas to the <i>saw&#257;sa</i> or page. After the marriage the bridegroom does not visit his wife for a month in order to ascertain whether she is already
pregnant. They then live together. The marriage expenses usually amount to Rs. 15 for the bridegroom&#8217;s father and Rs. 40 for
the bride&#8217;s father. Sometimes the bridegroom serves his father-in-law for his wife, and he is then not required to pay anything
for the marriage, the period of service being three years. If the couple anticipate the ceremony, however, they must leave
the house, and then are recalled by the bride&#8217;s parents, and readmitted into caste on giving a feast, which is in lieu of
the marriage ceremony. If they do not comply with the first summons of the parents, the latter finally sever connection <a id="d0e1117"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1117">6</a>]</span>with them. Widow marriage is freely permitted, and the widow is expected to marry her late husband&#8217;s younger brother, especially
if he is a bachelor. If she marries another man with his consent, the new husband gives him a turban and shoulder-cloth. The
children by the first husband are made over to his relatives if there are any. Divorce is permitted for adultery or extravagance
or ill-treatment by either party. A divorced wife can marry again, but if she absconds with another man without being divorced
the latter has to pay Rs. 12 to the husband.

<div class="div2" id="d0e1119">
<h3>3. Birth and death ceremonies.</h3>
<p>When a woman becomes pregnant for the first time, her mother goes to her taking a new cloth and cakes and a preparation of
milk, which is looked on as a luxurious food, and which, it is supposed, will strengthen the child in the womb. After birth
the mother is impure for five days. The dead are usually burnt, but children under six whose ears have not been pierced, and
persons dying a violent death or from cholera or smallpox are buried. When the principal man of the family dies, the caste-fellows
at the mourning feast tie a cloth round the head of his successor to show that they acknowledge his new position. They offer
water to the dead in the month of Kunw&#257;r (September-October).


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1124">
<h3>4. Religion and social customs.</h3>
<p>They have a vague belief in a supreme God but do not pay much attention to him. Their family god is Dulha Deo, to whom they
offer goats, fowls, cocoanuts and cakes. In the forest tracts they also worship Bura Deo, the chief god of the Gonds. The
deity who presides over their profession is Loh&#257;-Sur, the Iron demon, who is supposed to live in the smelting-kilns, and to
whom they offer a black hen. Formerly, it is said, they were accustomed to offer a black cow. They worship their smelting
implements on the day of Dasahra and during Ph&#257;gun, and offer fowls to them. They have little faith in medicine, and in cases
of sickness requisition the aid of the village sorcerer, who ascertains what deity is displeased with them by moving grain
to and fro in a winnowing-fan and naming the village gods in turn. He goes on repeating the names until his hand slackens
or stops at some name, and the offended god is thus indicated. He is then summoned and enters into the body of one of the
persons present, <a id="d0e1129"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1129">7</a>]</span>and explains his reason for being offended with the sick person, as that he has passed by the god&#8217;s shrine without taking
off his shoes, or omitted to make the triennial offering of a fowl or the like. Atonement is then promised and the offering
made, while the sick person on recovery notes the deity in question as one of a vindictive temper, whose worship must on no
account be neglected. The Agarias say that they do not admit outsiders into the caste, but Gonds, Kawars and Ah&#299;rs are occasionally
allowed to enter it. They refuse to eat monkeys, jackals, crocodiles, lizards, beef and the leavings of others. They eat pork
and fowls and drink liquor copiously. They take food from the higher castes and from Gonds and Baigas. Only Bahelias and other
impure castes will take food from them. Temporary excommunication from caste is imposed for conviction of a criminal offence,
getting maggots in a wound, and killing a cow, a dog or a cat. Permanent excommunication is imposed for adultery or eating
with a very low caste. Readmission to caste after temporary exclusion entails a feast, but if the offender is very poor he
simply gives a little liquor or even water. The Agarias are usually sunk in poverty, and their personal belongings are of
the scantiest description, consisting of a waist-cloth, and perhaps another wisp of cloth for the head, a brass <i>lota</i> or cup and a few earthen vessels. Their women dress like Gond women, and have a few pewter ornaments. They are profusely
tattooed with representations of flowers, scorpions and other objects. This is done merely for ornament.

<div class="div2" id="d0e1134">
<h3>5. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The caste still follow their traditional occupation of iron-smelting and also make a few agricultural implements. They get
their ore from the Maikal range, selecting stones of a dark reddish colour. They mix 16 lbs. of ore with 15 lbs. of charcoal
in the furnace, the blast being produced by a pair of bellows worked by the feet and conveyed to the furnace through bamboo
tubes; it is kept up steadily for four hours. The clay coating of the kiln is then broken down and the ball of molten slag
and charcoal is taken out and hammered, and about 3 lbs. of good iron are obtained. With this they make ploughshares, mattocks,
axes and sickles. They also move about from village to village with an anvil, a hammer <a id="d0e1139"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1139">8</a>]</span>and tongs, and building a small furnace under a tree, make and repair iron implements for the villagers.

</span><h2>Agharia</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1144">
<h3>1. Origin.</h3>
<p><b>Agharia</b><a id="d0e1150src" href="#d0e1150" class="noteref">1</a> (a corruption of Agaria, meaning one who came from Agra).&#8212;A cultivating caste belonging to the Sambalpur District<a id="d0e1153src" href="#d0e1153" class="noteref">2</a> and adjoining States. They number 27,000 persons in the Raigarh and S&#257;rangarh States and Bil&#257;spur District of the Central
Provinces, and are found also in some of the Chota N&#257;gpur States transferred from Bengal. According to the traditions of the
Agharias their forefathers were R&#257;jp&#363;ts who lived near Agra. They were accustomed to salute the king of Delhi with one hand
only and without bending the head. The king after suffering this for a long time determined to punish them for their contumacy,
and summoned all the Agharias to appear before him. At the door through which they were to pass to his presence he fixed a
sword at the height of a man&#8217;s neck. The haughty Agharias came to the door, holding their heads high and not seeing the sword,
and as a natural consequence they were all decapitated as they passed through. But there was one Agharia who had heard about
the fixing of the sword and who thought it better to stay at home, saying that he had some ceremony to perform. When the king
heard that there was one Agharia who had not passed through the door, he sent again, commanding him to come. The Agharia did
not wish to go but felt it impossible to decline. He therefore sent for a Cham&#257;r of his village and besought him to go instead,
saying that he would become a R&#257;jp&#363;t in his death and that he would ever be held in remembrance by the Agharia&#8217;s descendants.
The Cham&#257;r consented to sacrifice himself for his master, and going before the king was beheaded at the door. But the Agharia
fled south, taking his whole village with him, and came to Chhatt&#299;sgarh, where each of the families in the village founded
a clan of the Agharia caste. And in memory of this, whenever an Agharia makes a libation to his ancestors, he first pours
a little water on the ground in honour of the dead Cham&#257;r. According to <a id="d0e1156"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1156">9</a>]</span>another version of the story three brothers of different families escaped and first went to Orissa, where they asked the Gajpati
king to employ them as soldiers. The king caused two sheaths of swords to be placed before them, and telling them that one
contained a sword and the other a bullock-goad, asked them to select one and by their choice to determine whether they would
be soldiers or husbandmen. From one sheath a haft of gold projected and from the other one of silver. The Agharias pulled
out the golden haft and found that they had chosen the goad. The point of the golden and silver handles is obvious, and the
story is of some interest for the distant resemblance which it bears to the choice of the caskets in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. Condemned, as they considered, to drive the plough, the Agharias took off their sacred threads, which they could no longer
wear, and gave them to the youngest member of the caste, saying that he should keep them and be their Bh&#257;t, and they would
support him with contributions of a tenth of the produce of their fields. He assented, and his descendants are the genealogists
of the Agharias and are termed Dash&#257;nshi. The Agharias claim to be Somvansi R&#257;jp&#363;ts, a claim which Colonel Dalton says their
appearance favours. &#8220;Tall, well-made, with high Aryan features and tawny complexions, they look like R&#257;jp&#363;ts, though they
are more industrious and intelligent than the generality of the fighting tribe.&#8221;<a id="d0e1161src" href="#d0e1161" class="noteref">3</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1167">
<h3>2. Subdivisions.</h3>
<p>Owing to the fact that with the transfer of the Sambalpur District, a considerable portion of the Agharias have ceased to
be residents of the Central Provinces, it is unnecessary to give the details of their caste organisation at length. They have
two subdivisions, the Bad or superior Agharias and the Chhote, Sarolia or Sarwaria, the inferior or mixed Agharias. The latter
are a cross between an Agharia and a Gaur (Ah&#299;r) woman. The Bad Agharias will not eat with or even take water from the others.
Further local subdivisions are now in course of formation, as the Ratanpuria, Phuljharia and Raigarhia or those living round
Ratanpur, Phuljhar and Raigarh. The caste is said to have 84 <i>gotras</i> or exogamous sections, of which 60 bear the title of Patel, 18 that of N&#257;ik, and 6 of Chaudhri. The section names <a id="d0e1175"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1175">10</a>]</span>are very mixed, some being those of eponymous Br&#257;hman <i>gotras</i>, as S&#257;ndilya, Kaushik and Bh&#257;radw&#257;j; others those of R&#257;jp&#363;t septs, as Karchhul; while others are the names of animals and
plants, as Bar&#257;h (pig), Baram (the p&#299;pal tree), N&#257;g (cobra), Kachhapa (tortoise), and a number of other local terms the meaning
of which has been forgotten. Each of these sections, however, uses a different mark for branding cows, which it is the religious
duty of an Agharia to rear, and though the marks now convey no meaning, they were probably originally the representations
of material objects. In the case of names whose meaning is understood, traces of totemism survive in the respect paid to the
animal or plant by members of the sept which bears its name. This analysis of the structure of the caste shows that it was
a very mixed one. Originally consisting perhaps of a nucleus of immigrant R&#257;jp&#363;ts, the offspring of connections with inferior
classes have been assimilated; while the story already quoted is probably intended to signify, after the usual Br&#257;hmanical
fashion, that the pedigree of the Agharias at some period included a Cham&#257;r.

<h3>3. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>Marriage within the exogamous section and also with first cousins is forbidden, though in some places the union of a sister&#8217;s
son with a brother&#8217;s daughter is permitted. Child marriage is usual, and censure visits a man who allows an unmarried daughter
to arrive at adolescence. The bridegroom should always be older than the bride, at any rate by a day. When a betrothal is
arranged some ornaments and a cloth bearing the <i>swastik</i> or lucky mark are sent to the girl. Marriages are always celebrated during the months of M&#257;gh and Ph&#257;gun, and they are held
only once in five or six years, when all children whose matches can be arranged for are married off. This custom is economical,
as it saves expenditure on marriage feasts. Colonel Dalton also states that the Agharias always employ Hindust&#257;ni Br&#257;hmans
for their ceremonies, and as very few of these are available, they make circuits over large areas, and conduct all the weddings
of a locality at the same period. Before the marriage a kid is sacrificed at the bride&#8217;s house to celebrate the removal of
her status of maidenhood. When the bridegroom arrives at the bride&#8217;s house he touches with his dagger the <a id="d0e1188"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1188">11</a>]</span>string of mango-leaves suspended from the marriage-shed and presents a rupee and a hundred betel-leaves to the bride&#8217;s <i>saw&#257;sin</i> or attendant. Next day the bridegroom&#8217;s father sends a present of a bracelet and seven small earthen cups to the bride. She
is seated in the open, and seven women hold the cups over her head one above the other. Water is then poured from above from
one cup into the other, each being filled in turn and the whole finally falling on the bride&#8217;s head. This probably symbolises
the fertilising action of rain. The bride is then bathed and carried in a basket seven times round the marriage-post, after
which she is seated in a chair and seven women place their heads together round her while a male relative winds a thread seven
times round the heads of the women. The meaning of this ceremony is obscure. The bridegroom makes his appearance alone and
is seated with the bride, both being dressed in clothes coloured yellow with turmeric. The bridegroom&#8217;s party follows, and
the feet of the couple are washed with milk. The bride&#8217;s brother embraces the bridegroom and changes cloths with him. Water
is poured over the hands of the couple, the girl&#8217;s forehead is daubed with vermilion, and a red silk cloth is presented to
her and the couple go round the marriage-post. The bride is taken for four days to the husband&#8217;s house and then returns, and
is again sent with the usual <i>gauna</i> ceremony, when she is fit for conjugal relations. No price is usually paid for the bride, and each party spends about Rs.
100 on the marriage ceremony. Polygamy and widow marriage are generally allowed, the widow being disposed of by her parents.
The ceremony at the marriage of a widow consists in putting vermilion on the parting of her hair and bangles on her wrists.
Divorce is allowed on pain of a fine of Rs. 50 if the divorce is sought by the husband, and of Rs. 25 if the wife asks for
it. In some localities divorce and also polygamy are said to be forbidden, and in such cases a woman who commits adultery
is finally expelled from the caste, and a funeral feast is given to symbolise her death.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1196">
<h3>4. Religious and social customs.</h3>
<p>The family god of the Agharias is Dulha Deo, who exists in every household. On the Haraiti day or the commencement of the
agricultural year they worship the implements <a id="d0e1201"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1201">12</a>]</span>of cultivation, and at Dasahra the sword if they have one. They have a great reverence for cows and feed them sumptuously
at festivals. Every Agharia has a <i>guru</i> or spiritual guide who whispers the <i>mantra</i> or sacred verse into his ear and is occasionally consulted. The dead are usually burnt, but children and persons dying of
cholera or smallpox are buried, males being placed on the pyre or in the grave on their faces and females on their backs,
with the feet pointing to the south. On the third day the ashes are thrown into a river and the bones of each part of the
body are collected and placed under the pipal tree, while a pot is slung over them, through which water trickles continually
for a week, and a lighted lamp, cooked food, a leaf-cup and a tooth-stick are placed beside them daily for the use of the
deceased during the same period. Mourning ends on the tenth day, and the usual purification ceremonies are then performed.
Children are mourned for a shorter period. Well-to-do members of the caste feed a Br&#257;hman daily for a year after a death,
believing that food so given passes to the spirit of the deceased. On the anniversary of the death the caste-fellows are feasted,
and after that the deceased becomes a <i>purkha</i> or ancestor and participates in devotions paid at the <i>shr&#257;dhh</i> ceremony. When the head of a joint family dies, his successor is given a turban and betel-leaves, and his forehead is marked
by the priest and other relations with sandalwood. After a birth the mother is impure for twenty-one days. A feast is given
on the twelfth day, and sometimes the child is named then, but often children are not named until they are six years old.
The names of men usually end in <i>Ram</i>, <i>N&#257;th</i> or <i>Singh</i>, and those of women in <i>Kunwar</i>. Women do not name their husbands, their elderly relations, nor the sons of their husband&#8217;s eldest brother. A man does not
name his wife, as he thinks that to do so would tend to shorten his life in accordance with the Sanskrit saying, &#8216;He who is
desirous of long life should not name himself, his <i>guru</i>, a miser, his eldest son, or his wife.&#8217; The Agharias do not admit outsiders into the caste. They will not take cooked food
from any caste, and water only from a Gaur or R&#257;wat. They refuse to take water from an Uriya Br&#257;hman, probably in retaliation
for the refusal of Uriya Br&#257;hmans to accept <a id="d0e1230"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1230">13</a>]</span>water from an Agharia, though taking it from a Kolta. Both the Uriya Br&#257;hmans and Agharias are of somewhat doubtful origin,
and both are therefore probably the more concerned to maintain the social position to which they lay claim. But Kewats, R&#257;wats,
Telis and other castes eat cooked food from Agharias, and the caste therefore is admitted to a fairly high rank in the Uriya
country. The Agharias do not drink liquor or eat any food which a R&#257;jp&#363;t would refuse.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1232">
<h3>5. Occupation.</h3>
<p>As cultivators they are considered to be proficient. In the census of 1901 nearly a quarter of the whole caste were shown
as m&#257;lguz&#257;rs or village proprietors and lessees. They wear a coarse cloth of homespun yarn which they get woven for them by
G&#257;ndas; probably in consequence of this the Agharias do not consider the touch of the G&#257;nda to pollute them, as other castes
do. They will not grow turmeric, onions, garlic, <i>san</i>-hemp or tomatoes, nor will they rear tasar silk-cocoons. Colonel Dalton says that their women do no outdoor work, and this
is true in the Central Provinces as regards the better classes, but poor women work in the fields.

</span><h2>Aghori</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1243">
<h3>1. General accounts of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Aghori, Aghorpanthi.</b><a id="d0e1249src" href="#d0e1249" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;The most disreputable class of Saiva mendicants who feed on human corpses and excrement, and in past times practised cannibalism.
The sect is apparently an ancient one, a supposed reference to it being contained in the Sanskrit drama <i>M&#257;lati M&#257;dhava</i>, the hero of which rescues his mistress from being offered as a sacrifice by one named Aghori Ghanta.<a id="d0e1261src" href="#d0e1261" class="noteref">2</a> According to Lassen, quoted by Sir H. Risley, the Aghoris of the present day are closely connected with the Kap&#257;lika sect
of the Middle Ages, who wore crowns and necklaces of skulls and offered human sacrifices to Ch&#257;munda, a form of Devi. The
Aghoris now represent their filthy habits as merely giving practical expression to the abstract doctrine that the whole universe
is full of Brahma, and consequently that one thing is as pure as another. By eating the most horrible food they utterly subdue
their natural appetites, and hence acquire great power <a id="d0e1267"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1267">14</a>]</span>over themselves and over the forces of nature. It is believed that an Aghori can at will assume the shapes of a bird, an animal
or a fish, and that he can bring back to life a corpse of which he has eaten a part. The principal resort of the Aghoris appears
to be at Ben&#257;res and at Girnar near Mount Abu, and they wander about the country as solitary mendicants. A few reside in Saugor,
and they are occasionally met with in other places. They are much feared and disliked by the people owing to their practice
of extorting alms by the threat to carry out their horrible practices before the eyes of their victims, and by throwing filth
into their houses. Similarly they gash and cut their limbs so that the crime of blood may rest on those who refuse to give.
&#8220;For the most part,&#8221; Mr. Barrow states,<a id="d0e1269src" href="#d0e1269" class="noteref">3</a> &#8220;the Aghorpanthis lead a wandering life, are without homes, and prefer to dwell in holes, clefts of rocks and burning-<i>gh&#257;ts</i>. They do not cook, but eat the fragments given them in charity as received, which they put as far as may be into the cavity
of the skull used as a begging-bowl. The bodies of <i>chelas</i> (disciples) who die in Ben&#257;res are thrown into the Ganges, but the dead who die well off are placed in coffins. As a rule,
Aghoris do not care what becomes of their bodies, but when buried they are placed in the grave sitting cross-legged. The Aghori
<i>gurus</i> keep dogs, which may be of any colour, and are said to be maintained for purposes of protection. The dogs are not all pariahs
of the streets, although some <i>gurus</i> are followed by three or four when on pilgrimage. Occasionally the dogs seem to be regarded with real affection by their
strange masters. The Aghori is believed to hold converse with all the evil spirits frequenting the burning-<i>gh&#257;ts</i>, and funeral parties must be very badly off who refuse to pay him something. In former days he claimed five pieces of wood
at each funeral in Ben&#257;res; but the Doms interfere with his perquisites, and in some cases only let him carry off the remains
of the unburned wood from each pyre. When angered and excited, Aghoris invoke K&#257;li and threaten to spread devastation around
them. Even among the educated classes, who should know better, they are dreaded, and as an instance of the terror which they
create among the ignorant, it may be <a id="d0e1289"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1289">15</a>]</span>mentioned that in the Lucknow District it is believed that if alms are refused them the Aghoris will cause those who refuse
to be attacked with fever.

</div><p>


</p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, their good offices may secure benefits, as in the case of a zam&#299;nd&#257;r of Muzaffarnagar, who at Allah&#257;b&#257;d
refused to eat a piece of human flesh offered to him by an Aghori; the latter thereupon threw the flesh at the zam&#299;nd&#257;r&#8217;s
head, on which it stuck. The zam&#299;nd&#257;r afterwards became so exceedingly wealthy that he had difficulty in storing his wealth.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1297">
<h3>2. Instances of cannibalism.</h3>
<p>In former times it is believed that the Aghoris used to kidnap strangers, sacrifice them to the goddess and eat the bodies,
and Mr. Barrow relates the following incident of the murder of a boy:<a id="d0e1302src" href="#d0e1302" class="noteref">4</a> &#8220;Another horrible case, unconnected with magic and apparently arising from mere blood-thirst, occurred at Neir&#257;d in June
1878. An Aghori mendicant of Dw&#257;rka staying at the temple of Sit&#257;r&#257;m L&#257;ld&#257;s seized a boy of twelve, named Shankar R&#257;md&#257;s,
who was playing with two other boys, threw him down on the <i>oatla</i> of the temple, ripped open his abdomen, tore out part of his entrails, and, according to the poor little victim&#8217;s dying declaration,
began to eat them. The other boys having raised an alarm, the monster was seized. When interrogated by the magistrate as to
whether he had committed the crime in order to perform Aghorbidya, the prisoner said that as the boy was Bhakshan he had eaten
his flesh. He added that if he had not been interrupted he would have eaten all the entrails. He was convicted, but only sentenced
to transportation for life. The High Court, however, altered the sentence and ordered the prisoner to be hanged.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The following instance, quoted by Mr. Barrow from Rewah, shows how an Aghori was hoist with his own petard: &#8220;Some years ago,
when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bishn&#257;th Singh was Chief of Rewah, a man of the Aghori caste went to Rewah and sat <i>dharna</i> on the steps of the palace; having made ineffectual demands for alms, he requested to be supplied with human flesh, and for
five days abstained from food. The Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was much troubled, and at last, in order to get rid of his unwelcome visitor,
sent for Ghansi&#257;m D&#257;s, <a id="d0e1313"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1313">16</a>]</span>another Aghori, a Fak&#299;r, who had for some years lived in Rewah. Ghansi&#257;m D&#257;s went up to the other Aghori and asked him if
it was true that he had asked to be supplied with human flesh. On receiving a reply in the affirmative, Ghansi&#257;m D&#257;s said:
&#8216;Very well, I too am extremely partial to this form of food; here is my hand, eat it and I will eat you&#8217;; and at the same
time he seized hold of the other&#8217;s hand and began to gnaw at it. The Aghori on this became much alarmed and begged to be excused.
He shortly afterwards left Rewah and was not heard of again, while Ghansi&#257;m D&#257;s was rewarded for his services.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The following recent instance of an Aghori devouring human corpses is reported from the Punjab:<a id="d0e1317src" href="#d0e1317" class="noteref">5</a> &#8220;The loathsome story of a human ghoul from Pati&#257;la shows that the influence of the Aghorpanthi has not yet completely died
out in this country. It is said that for some time past human graves have been found robbed of their contents, and the mystery
could not be solved until the other day, when the police succeeded in arresting a man in the act of desecrating a child&#8217;s
grave, some forty miles distant from the capital (Pati&#257;la). The ghoul not only did not conceal the undevoured portion of the
corpse he had with him, but told his captors the whole story of his gruesome career. He is a low-caste Hindu named R&#257;m N&#257;th,
and is, according to a gentleman who saw him, &#8216;a singularly mild and respectful-looking man, instead of a red-eyed and ravenous
savage,&#8217; as he had expected to find him from the accounts of his disgusting propensities. He became an orphan at five and
fell into the hands of two S&#257;dhus of his own caste, who were evidently Aghorpanthis. They taught him to eat human flesh, which
formed the staple of their food. The meat was procured from the graves in the villages they passed through. When R&#257;m N&#257;th
was thoroughly educated in this rank the S&#257;dhus deserted him. Since then he had been living on human carrion only, roaming
about the country like a hungry vulture. He cannot eat cooked food, and therefore gets two seers of raw meat from the State
every day. It is also reported that the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has <a id="d0e1325"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1325">17</a>]</span>now prohibited his being given anything but cooked food with a view to reforming him.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Sir J. B. Fuller relates the following incident of the employment of an Aghori as a servant:<a id="d0e1329src" href="#d0e1329" class="noteref">6</a> &#8220;There are actually ten thousand persons who at census time classed themselves as Aghoris. All of them do not practise cannibalism
and some of them attempt to rise in the world. One of them secured service as a cook with a British officer of my acquaintance.
My friend was in camp in the jungle with his wife and children, when his other servants came to him in a body and refused
to remain in service unless the cook was dismissed, since they had discovered, they declared, that during the night-time he
visited cemeteries and dug up the bodies of freshly buried children. The cook was absent, but they pointed to a box of his
that emitted a sickening smell. The man was incontinently expelled, but for long afterwards the family were haunted by reminiscences
of the curries they had eaten.&#8221;

<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Ah&#299;r,<a id="d0e1447src" href="#d0e1447" class="noteref">1</a> Gaoli, Gu&#257;la, Golkar, Gaol&#257;n, R&#257;wat, Gahra, Mah&#257;kul.</b>&#8212;The caste, of cowherds, milkmen and cattle-breeders. In 1911 the Ah&#299;rs numbered nearly 750,000 persons in the Central Provinces
and Ber&#257;r, being the sixth caste in point of numbers. This figure, however, excludes 150,000 Gow&#257;ris or graziers of the Mar&#257;tha
Districts, and if these were added the Ah&#299;rs would outnumber the Telis and rank fifth. The name Ah&#299;r is derived from Abh&#299;ra,
a tribe mentioned several times in inscriptions and the Hindu sacred books. Go&#257;la, a cowherd, from Gop&#257;la,<a id="d0e1451src" href="#d0e1451" class="noteref">2</a> a protector of cows, is the Bengali name for the caste, and Gaoli, with the same signification, is now used in the Central
Provinces to signify a dairyman as opposed to a grazier. The Gaol&#257;ns appear to be an inferior class of Gaolis in Ber&#257;r. The
Golkars of Ch&#257;nda may be derived from the Telugu Golars or graziers, with a probable <a id="d0e1468"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1468">19</a>]</span>admixture of Gond blood. They are described as wild-looking people scattered about in the most thickly forested tracts of
the District, where they graze and tend cattle. R&#257;wat, a corruption of R&#257;jp&#363;tra or a princeling, is the name borne by the
Ah&#299;r caste in Chhatt&#299;sgarh; while Gahra is their designation in the Uriya country. The Mah&#257;kul Ah&#299;rs are a small group found
in the Jashpur State, and said to belong to the N&#257;ndvansi division. The name means &#8216;Great family.&#8217;

<h3>2. Former dominance of the Abh&#299;ras.</h3>
<p>The Abh&#299;ras appear to have been one of the immigrant tribes from Central Asia who entered India shortly before or about the
commencement of the Christian era. In the Pur&#257;nas and Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata they are spoken of as Dasyu or robbers, and Mlechchhas or
foreigners, in the story which says that Arjuna, after he had burned the dead bodies of Krishna and Bal&#257;r&#257;m at Dw&#257;rka, was
proceeding with the widows of the Y&#257;dava princes to Mathura through the Punjab when he was waylaid by the Abh&#299;ras and deprived
of his treasures and beautiful women.<a id="d0e1479src" href="#d0e1479" class="noteref">3</a> An inscription of the S&#257;ka era 102, or <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 180, speaks of a grant made by the Senapati or commander-in-chief of the state, who is called an Abh&#299;ra, the locality being
Sunda in K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r. Another inscription found in N&#257;sik and assigned by Mr. Enthoven to the fourth century speaks of an Abh&#299;ra
king, and the Pur&#257;nas say that after the Andhrabhrityas the Deccan was held by the Abh&#299;ras, the west coast tract from the
T&#257;pti to Deogarh being called by their name.<a id="d0e1487src" href="#d0e1487" class="noteref">4</a> In the time of Samudragupta in the middle of the fourth century the Abh&#299;ras were settled in Eastern R&#257;jputana and M&#257;lwa.<a id="d0e1496src" href="#d0e1496" class="noteref">5</a> When the K&#257;this arrived in Gujar&#257;t in the eighth century, they found the greater part of the country in the possession of

In many castes there is a separate division of Ah&#299;rs, such as the Ah&#299;r Sun&#257;rs,
Sut&#257;rs, Loh&#257;rs, Shimp&#299;s, Sal&#299;s, Guraos and Kolis. The fort of As&#299;rgarh in Nim&#257;r bordering on Kh&#257;ndesh is supposed to have
been founded by one Asa Ah&#299;r, who lived in the beginning of the fifteenth century. It is said that his ancestors had held
land here for seven hundred years, and he had 10,000 cattle, 20,000 sheep and 1000 mares, with 2000 followers; but was still
known to the people, to whom his benevolence had endeared him, by the simple name of Asa. This derivation of As&#299;rgarh is clearly
erroneous, as it was known as As&#299;r or As&#299;rgarh, and held by the T&#257;k and Chauh&#257;n R&#257;jp&#363;ts from the eleventh century. But the
story need not on that account, Mr. Grant says,<a id="d0e1517src" href="#d0e1517" class="noteref">9</a> be set down as wholly a fable. Firishta, who records it, has usually a good credit, and more probably the real existence
of a line of Ah&#299;r chieftains in the Tapti valley suggested a convenient ethnology for the fortress. Other traditions of the past domination of the pastoral tribes remain in the Central Provinces. Deogarh
on the Chhindw&#257;ra plateau was, according to the legend, the last seat of Gaoli power prior to its subversion by the Gonds
in the sixteenth century. J&#257;tba, the founder of the Deogarh Gond dynasty, is said to have entered the service of the Gaoli
rulers, Mansur and Gansur, and subsequently with the aid of the goddess Devi to have slain them and usurped their kingdom.
But a Gaoli chief still retained possession of the fort of Narn&#257;la for a few years longer, when he also was slain by the Muhammadans.
Similarly the fort of G&#257;wilgarh on the southern crest of the Satp&#363;ras is said to be named after a Gaoli chief who founded
it. The Saugor traditions bring down the Gaoli supremacy to a much later date, as the tracts of Et&#257;wa and Khurai are held
to have been governed by their chieftains till the close of the seventeenth century.

<h3>3. Ah&#299;r dialects.</h3>
<p>Certain dialects called after the Abh&#299;ras or Ah&#299;rs still remain. One, known as Ah&#299;rwati, is spoken in the Rohtak and Gurgaon
Districts of the Punjab and round Delhi. This is akin to Mew&#257;ti, one of the forms of R&#257;jasth&#257;ni or the <a id="d0e1530"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1530">21</a>]</span>language of R&#257;jput&#257;na. The M&#257;lwi dialect of R&#257;jasth&#257;ni is also known as Ah&#299;ri; and that curious form of Gujar&#257;ti, which is
half a Bh&#299;l dialect, and is generally known as Kh&#257;ndeshi, also bears the name of Ah&#299;rani.<a id="d0e1532src" href="#d0e1532" class="noteref">10</a> The above linguistic facts seem to prove only that the Abh&#299;ras, or their occupational successors, the Ah&#299;rs, were strongly
settled in the Delhi country of the Punjab, M&#257;lwa and Kh&#257;ndesh. They do not seem to throw much light on the origin of the
Abh&#299;ras or Ah&#299;rs, and necessarily refer only to a small section of the existing Ah&#299;r caste, the great bulk of whom speak the
Aryan language current where they dwell. Another authority states, however, that the Ah&#299;rs of Gujar&#257;t still retain a dialect
of their own, and concludes that this and the other Ah&#299;r dialects are the remains of the distinct Abh&#299;ra language.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1537">
<h3>4. The Y&#257;davas and Krishna.</h3>
<p>It cannot necessarily be assumed that all the above traditions relate to the Abh&#299;ra tribe proper, of which the modern Ah&#299;r
caste are scarcely more than the nominal representatives. Nevertheless, it may fairly be concluded from them that the Abh&#299;ras
were widely spread over India and dominated considerable tracts of country. They are held to have entered India about the
same time as the Sakas, who settled in Gujar&#257;t, among other places, and, as seen above, the earliest records of the Abh&#299;ras
show them in N&#257;sik and K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r, and afterwards widely spread in Kh&#257;ndesh, that is, in the close neighbourhood of the Sakas.
It has been suggested in the article on R&#257;jp&#363;t that the Y&#257;dava and other lunar clans of R&#257;jp&#363;ts may be the representatives
of the Sakas and other nomad tribes who invaded India shortly before and after the Christian era. The god Krishna is held
to have been the leader of the Y&#257;davas, and to have founded with them the sacred city of Dw&#257;rka in Gujar&#257;t. The modern Ah&#299;rs
have a subdivision called J&#257;duvansi or Y&#257;duvansi, that is, of the race of the Y&#257;davas, and they hold that Krishna was of the
Ah&#299;r tribe. Since the Abh&#299;ras were also settled in Gujar&#257;t it is possible that they may have been connected with the Y&#257;davas,
and that this may be the foundation for their claim that Krishna was of their tribe. The Dyashraya-Kavya of Hemachandra speaks
of a Chordasama prince reigning near Junagarh as <a id="d0e1542"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1542">22</a>]</span>an Abh&#299;ra and a Y&#257;dava. But this is no doubt very conjectural, and the simple fact that Krishna was a herdsman would be a
sufficient reason for the Ah&#299;rs to claim connection with him. It is pointed out that the names of Abh&#299;ra chieftains given
in the early inscriptions are derived from the god Siva, and this would not have been the case if they had at that epoch derived
their origin from Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. &#8220;If the Abh&#299;ras had really been the descendants of the cowherds (Gopas)
whose hero was Krishna, the name of the rival god Siva would never have formed components of the names of the Abh&#299;ras, whom
we find mentioned in inscriptions. Hence the conclusion may safely be drawn that the Abh&#299;ras were by no means connected with
Krishna and his cowherds even as late as about <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 300, to which date the first of the two inscriptions mentioned above is to be assigned. Precisely the same conclusion is
pointed to by the contents of the Harivansha and Bhagwat Pur&#257;na. The upbringing of Krishna among the cowherds and his flirtations
with the milkmaids are again and again mentioned in these works, but the word Abh&#299;ra does not occur even once in this connection.
The only words we find used are Gopa, Gopi and Vraja. This is indeed remarkable. For the descriptions of the removal of Krishna
as an infant to Nanda, the cowherd&#8217;s hut, of his childhood passed in playing with the cowherd boys, and of his youth spent
in amorous sports with the milkmaids are set forth at great length, but the word Abh&#299;ra is not once met with. From this only
one conclusion is possible, that is, that the Abh&#299;ras did not originally represent the Gopas of Krishna. The word Abh&#299;ra occurs
for the first time in connection with the Krishna legend about <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 550, from which it follows that the Abh&#299;ras came to be identified with the Gopas shortly before that date.&#8221;<a id="d0e1550src" href="#d0e1550" class="noteref">11</a>

</p>
<p>This argument is interesting as showing that Abh&#299;ra was not originally an occupational term for a herdsman, nor a caste name,
but belonged to an immigrant tribe. Owing apparently to the fact that the Abh&#299;ras, like the G&#363;jars, devoted themselves to
a pastoral mode of life in India, whereas the previous Aryan immigrants had settled down to cultivation, <a id="d0e1556"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1556">23</a>]</span>they gave their name to the great occupational caste of herdsmen which was subsequently developed, and of which they may originally
have constituted the nucleus. The G&#363;jars, who came to India at a later period, form a parallel case; although the G&#363;jar caste,
which is derived from them, is far less important than the Ah&#299;r, the G&#363;jars have also been the parents of several R&#257;jp&#363;t clans.
The reason why the early Mathura legends of Krishna make no mention of the Ah&#299;rs may be that the deity Krishna is probably
compounded of at least two if not more distinct personalities. One is the hero chief of the Y&#257;davas, who fought in the battle
of the Pandavas and Kauravas, migrated to Gujar&#257;t and was killed there. As he was chief of the Y&#257;davas this Krishna must stand
for the actual or mythical personality of some leader of the immigrant nomad tribes. The other Krishna, the boy cowherd, who
grazed cattle and sported with the milkmaids of Brind&#257;ban, may very probably be some hero of the indigenous non-Aryan tribes,
who, then as now, lived in the forests and were shepherds and herdsmen. His lowly birth from a labouring cowherd, and the
fact that his name means black and he is represented in sculpture as being of a dark colour, lend support to this view. The
cult of Krishna, Mr. Crooke points out, was comparatively late, and probably connected with the development of the worship
of the cow after the decay of Buddhism. This latter Krishna, who is worshipped with his mother as a child-god, was especially
attractive to women, both actual and prospective mothers. It is quite probable therefore that as his worship became very popular
in Hindust&#257;n in connection with that of the cow, he was given a more illustrious origin by identification with the Y&#257;dava
hero, whose first home was apparently in Gujar&#257;t. In this connection it may also be noted that the episodes connected with
Krishna in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata have been considered late interpolations.

<h3>5. The modern Ah&#299;rs an occupational caste.</h3>
<p>But though the Ah&#299;r caste takes its name and is perhaps partly descended from the Abh&#299;ra tribe, there is no doubt that it
is now and has been for centuries a purely occupational caste, largely recruited from the indigenous tribes. Thus in Bengal
Colonel Dalton remarks that the features of the Mathur&#257;v&#257;si Go&#257;las are high, sharp and delicate, and <a id="d0e1563"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1563">24</a>]</span>they are of light-brown complexion. Those of the Magadha subcaste, on the other hand, are undefined and coarse. They are dark-complexioned,
and have large hands and feet. &#8220;Seeing the latter standing in a group with some Singhbh&#363;m Kols, there is no distinguishing
one from the other. There has doubtless been much mixture of blood.&#8221;<a id="d0e1565src" href="#d0e1565" class="noteref">12</a> Similarly in the Central Provinces the Ah&#299;rs are largely recruited from the Gonds and other tribes. In Ch&#257;nda the Gow&#257;ris
are admittedly descended from the unions of Gonds and Ah&#299;rs, and one of their subcastes, the Gond-Gow&#257;ris, are often classed
as Gonds. Again, the Kaonra Ah&#299;rs of Mandla are descended from the unions of Ah&#299;rs either with the Gonds or Kawars, and many
of them are probably pure Gonds. They have Gond sept-names and eat pork. Members of one of their subdivisions, the Gond-Kaonra,
will take water from Gonds, and rank below the other Kaonras, from whom they will accept food and water. As cattle have to
go into the thick jungles to graze in the hot weather, the graziers attending them become intimate with the forest tribes
who live there, and these latter are also often employed to graze the cattle, and are perhaps after a time admitted to the
Ah&#299;r caste. Many Ah&#299;rs in Mandla are scarcely considered to be Hindus, living as they do in Gond villages in sole company
with the Gonds.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1571">
<h3>6. Subcastes.</h3>
<p>The principal subcastes of the Ah&#299;rs in northern India are the J&#257;duvansi, N&#257;ndvansi and Gow&#257;lvansi. The J&#257;duvansi claimed
to be descended from the Y&#257;davas, who now form the Y&#257;du and J&#257;don-Bhatti clans of R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The probability of a historical
connection between the Abh&#299;ras and Y&#257;davas has already been noticed. The N&#257;ndvansi consider their first ancestor to have been
N&#257;nd, the cowherd, the foster-father of Krishna; while the name of the Gow&#257;lvansi is simply Go&#257;la or Gauli, a milkman, a common
synonym for the caste. The Kaonra Ah&#299;rs of Mandla and the Kamarias of Jubbulpore are considered to belong to the N&#257;ndvansi
group. Other subcastes in the northern Districts are the Jijhotia, who, like the Jijhotia Br&#257;hmans, take their name from Jajhoti,
the classical term for Bundelkhand; the Bharotia; and the Narwaria from Narwar. The R&#257;wats <a id="d0e1576"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1576">25</a>]</span>of Chhatt&#299;sgarh are divided into the Jhadia, Kosaria and Kanaujia groups. Of these the Jhadia or &#8216;jungly,&#8217; and Kosaria from
Kosala, the ancient name of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh country, are the oldest settlers, while the Kanaujia are largely employed as
personal servants in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, and all castes will take water from their hands. The superior class of them, however, refuse
to clean household cooking vessels, and are hence known as Thethw&#257;r, or exact or pure, as distinguished from the other R&#257;wats,
who will perform this somewhat derogatory work.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1578">
<h3>7. The Dauwa or wet-nurse Ah&#299;rs. Fosterage.</h3>
<p>The Dauwa or wet-nurse Ah&#299;rs are descended from the illegitimate offspring of Bundela R&#257;jp&#363;t fathers by Ah&#299;r mothers who were
employed in this capacity in their families. An Ah&#299;r woman kept by a Bundela was known as Pardw&#257;rin, or one coming from another
house. This is not considered a disgraceful origin; though the Dauwa Ah&#299;rs are not recognised by the Ah&#299;rs proper, they form
a separate section of the caste, and Br&#257;hmans will take water from them. The children of such mothers stood in the relation
of foster-brothers to the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, whom their mothers had nursed. The giving of milk, in accordance with the common primitive
belief in the virtue attaching to an action in itself, was held to constitute a relation of quasi-maternity between the nurse
and infant, and hence of fraternity between her own children and her foster-children. The former were called Dhai-bhais or
foster-brothers by the R&#257;jp&#363;ts; they were often given permanent grants of land and employed on confidential missions, as for
the arrangement of marriages. The minister of a R&#257;ja of Karauli was his Dauwa or foster-father, the husband of his nurse.
Similarly, Colonel Tod says that the Dhai-bhai or foster-brother of the R&#257;ja of Boondi, commandant of the fortress of Tanagarh,
was, like all his class, devotion personified.<a id="d0e1583src" href="#d0e1583" class="noteref">13</a> A parallel instance of the tie of foster-kinship occurs in the case of the foster-brothers of Conachar or Hector in <i>The Fair Maid of Perth</i>. Thus the position of foster-brother of a R&#257;jp&#363;t was an honourable one, even though the child might be illegitimate. Ah&#299;r
women were often employed as wet-nurses, because domestic service was a profession in which they commonly engaged. Owing <a id="d0e1591"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1591">26</a>]</span>to the comparatively humble origin of a large proportion of them they did not object to menial service, while the purity of
their caste made it possible to use them for the supply of water and food. In Bengal the Uriya Ah&#299;rs were a common class of
servants in European houses.

</p>
<p>The Gaolis or milkmen appear to form a distinct branch of the caste with subcastes of their own. Among them are the N&#257;ndvans,
common to the Ah&#299;rs, the M&#257;lwi from M&#257;lwa and the R&#257;ghuvansi, called after the R&#257;jp&#363;t clan of that name. The R&#257;nyas take their
designation from <i>r&#257;n</i>, forest, like the Jh&#257;dia R&#257;wats.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1598">
<h3>8. Exogamy.</h3>
<p>The caste have exogamous sections, which are of the usual low-caste type, with titular or totemistic names. Those of the Chhatt&#299;sgarhi
R&#257;wats are generally named after animals. A curious name among the Mah&#257;kul Ah&#299;rs is Math&#257;nk&#257;ta, or one who bit his mother&#8217;s
nipples. The marriage of persons belonging to the same section and of first cousins is prohibited. A man may marry his wife&#8217;s
younger sister while his wife is living, but not her elder sister. The practice of exchanging girls between families is permissible.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1603">
<h3>9. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>As a rule, girls may be married before or after puberty, but the Golkars of Ch&#257;nda insist on infant marriage, and fine the
parents if an unmarried girl becomes adolescent. On the other hand, the Kaonra Ah&#299;rs of Mandla make a practice of not getting
a girl married till the signs of puberty have appeared. It is said that in Mandla if an unmarried girl becomes pregnant by
a man of the caste the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> give her to him and fine him Rs. 20 or 30, which they appropriate themselves, giving nothing to the father. If an Ah&#299;r girl
is seduced by an outsider, she is made over to him, and a fine of Rs. 40 or 50 is exacted from him if possible. This is paid
to the girl&#8217;s father, who has to spend it on a penalty feast to the caste. Generally, sexual offences within the community
are leniently regarded. The wedding ceremony is of the type prevalent in the locality. The proposal comes from the boy&#8217;s family,
and a price is usually given for the bride. The Kaonra Ah&#299;rs of Mandla and the Jharia and Kosaria R&#257;wats of Chhatt&#299;sgarh employ
a Br&#257;hman only to write the <i>lagun</i> or paper fixing the date of the wedding, and the ceremony is conducted by the <i>saw&#257;sins</i> or relatives of <a id="d0e1617"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1617">27</a>]</span>the parties. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the bridegroom is dressed as a girl to be taken to the wedding. In Bet&#363;l the weddings of most
Gaolis are held in M&#257;gh (January), and that of the R&#257;nya subcaste in the bright fortnight of K&#257;rtik (October). At the ceremony
the bride is made to stand on a small stone roller; the bridegroom then takes hold of the roller facing the bride and goes
round in a circle seven times, turning the roller with him. Widow remarriage is permitted, and a widow is often expected to
marry the younger brother of her deceased husband. If a bachelor wishes to marry a widow he first goes through the ceremony
with a dagger or an earthen vessel. Divorce is freely permitted. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d a strip is torn off the clothes worn by husband
and wife as a sign of their divorce. This is presumably in contrast to the knotting of the clothes of the couple together
at a wedding.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1619">
<h3>10. Birth customs.</h3>
<p>Among the R&#257;wats of Chhatt&#299;sgarh, when a child is shortly to be born the midwife dips her hand in oil and presses it on the
wall, and it is supposed that she can tell by the way in which the oil trickles down whether the child will be a boy or a
girl. If a woman is weak and ill during her pregnancy it is thought that a boy will be born, but if she is strong and healthy,
a girl. A woman in advanced pregnancy is given whatever she desires to eat, and on one occasion especially delicate kinds
of food are served to her, this rite being known as Sidhori. The explanation of the custom is that if the mother does not
get the food she desires during pregnancy the child will long for it all through life. If delivery is delayed, a line of men
and boys is sometimes made from the door of the house to a well, and a vessel is then passed from hand to hand from the house,
filled with water, and back again. Thus the water, having acquired the quality of speed during its rapid transit, will communicate
this to the woman and cause her quick delivery. Or they take some of the clay left unmoulded on the potter&#8217;s wheel and give
it her to drink in water; the explanation of this is exactly similar, the earth having acquired the quality of swiftness by
the rapid transit on the wheel. If three boys or three girls have been born to a woman, they think that the fourth should
be of the same sex, in order to make up <a id="d0e1624"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1624">28</a>]</span>two pairs. A boy or girl born after three of the opposite sex is called Titra or Titri, and is considered very unlucky. To
avert this misfortune they cover the child with a basket, kindle a fire of grass all round it, and smash a brass pot on the
floor. Then they say that the baby is the fifth and not the fourth child, and the evil is thus removed. When one woman gives
birth to a male and another to a female child in the same quarter of a village on the same day and they are attended by the
same midwife, it is thought that the boy child will fall ill from the contagion of the girl child communicated through the
midwife. To avoid this, on the following Sunday the child&#8217;s maternal uncle makes a banghy, which is carried across the shoulders
like a large pair of scales, and weighs the child in it against cowdung. He then takes the banghy and deposits it at cross-roads
outside the village. The father cannot see either the child or its mother till after the Chathi or sixth-day ceremony of purification,
when the mother is bathed and dressed in clean clothes, the males of the family are shaved, all their clothes are washed,
and the house is whitewashed; the child is also named on this day. The mother cannot go out of doors until after the B&#257;rhi
or twelfth-day ceremony. If a child is born at an unlucky astrological period its ears are pierced in the fifth month after
birth as a means of protection.

<h3>11. Funeral rites. Bringing back the soul.</h3>
<p>The dead are either buried or burnt. When a man is dying they put basil leaves and boiled rice and milk in his mouth, and
a little piece of gold, or if they have not got gold they put a rupee in his mouth and take it out again. For ten days after
a death, food in a leaf-cup and a lamp are set out in the house-yard every evening, and every morning water and a tooth-stick.
On the tenth day they are taken away and consigned to a river. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh on the third day after death the soul is brought
back. The women put a lamp on a red earthen pot and go to a tank or stream at night. The fish are attracted towards the light,
and one of them is caught and put in the pot, which is then filled with water. It is brought home and set beside a small heap
of flour, and the elders sit round it. The son of the deceased or other near relative anoints himself with turmeric and picks
up a stone. This is washed with the water from <a id="d0e1635"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1635">29</a>]</span>the pot, and placed on the floor, and a sacrifice of a cock or hen is made to it according as the deceased was a man or a
woman. The stone is then enshrined in the house as a family god, and the sacrifice of a fowl is repeated annually. It is supposed
apparently that the dead man&#8217;s spirit is brought back to the house in the fish, and then transferred to the stone by washing
this with the water.

<h3>12. Religion. Krishna and other deified cowherds.</h3>
<p>The Ah&#299;rs have a special relation to the Hindu religion, owing to their association with the sacred cow, which is itself revered
as a goddess. When religion gets to the anthropomorphic stage the cowherd, who partakes of the cow&#8217;s sanctity, may be deified
as its representative. This was probably the case with Krishna, one of the most popular gods of Hinduism, who was a cowherd,
and, as he is represented as being of a dark colour, may even have been held to be of the indigenous races. Though, according
to the legend, he was really of royal birth, Krishna was brought up by N&#257;nd, a herdsman of Gokul, and Jasoda or Dasoda his
wife, and in the popular belief these are his parents, as they probably were in the original story. The substitution of Krishna,
born as a prince, for Jasoda&#8217;s daughter, in order to protect him from destruction by the evil king K&#257;nsa of Mathura, is perhaps
a later gloss, devised when his herdsman parentage was considered too obscure for the divine hero. Krishna&#8217;s childhood in
Jasoda&#8217;s house with his miraculous feats of strength and his amorous sports with R&#257;dha and the other milkmaids of Brind&#257;wan,
are among the most favourite Hindu legends. Govind and Gop&#257;l, the protector or guardian of cows, are names of Krishna and
the commonest names of Hindus, as are also his other epithets, Murlidhar and Bansidhar, the flute-player; for Krishna and
Bal&#257;r&#257;m, like Greek and Roman shepherds, were accustomed to divert themselves with song, to the accompaniment of the same
instrument. The child Krishna is also very popular, and his birthday, the Janam-Ashtami on the 8th of dark Bh&#257;don (August),
is a great festival. On this day potsful of curds are sprinkled over the assembled worshippers. Krishna, however, is not the
solitary instance of the divine cowherd, but has several companions, humble indeed compared to him, but perhaps owing their
apotheosis to the same reasons. Bh&#299;lat, a popular local godling of the <a id="d0e1642"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1642">30</a>]</span>Nerbudda Valley, was the son of an Ah&#299;r or Gaoli woman; she was childless and prayed to P&#257;rvati for a child, and the goddess
caused her votary to have one by her own husband, the god Mah&#257;deo. Bh&#299;lat was stolen away from his home by Mah&#257;deo in the
disguise of a beggar, and grew up to be a great hero and made many conquests; but finally he returned and lived with his herdsman
parents, who were no doubt his real ones. He performed numerous miracles, and his devotees are still possessed by his spirit.
Sing&#257;ji is another godling who was a Gaoli by caste in Indore. He became a disciple of a holy Gokulastha Gosain or ascetic,
and consequently a great observer of the Janam-Ashtami or Krishna&#8217;s birthday.<a id="d0e1644src" href="#d0e1644" class="noteref">14</a> On one occasion Sing&#257;ji was late for prayers on this day, and the <i>guru</i> was very angry, and said to him, &#8216;Don&#8217;t show your face to me again until you are dead.&#8217; Sing&#257;ji went home and told the other
children he was going to die. Then he went and buried himself alive. The occurrence was noised abroad and came to the ears
of the <i>guru</i>, who was much distressed, and proceeded to offer his condolences to Sing&#257;ji&#8217;s family. But on the way he saw Sing&#257;ji, who
had been miraculously raised from the dead on account of his virtuous act of obedience, grazing his buffaloes as before. After
asking for milk, which Sing&#257;ji drew from a male buffalo calf, the <i>guru</i> was able to inform the bereaved parents of their son&#8217;s joyful reappearance and his miraculous powers; of these Sing&#257;ji gave
further subsequent demonstration, and since his death, said to have occurred 350 years ago, is widely venerated. The Gaolis
pray to him for the protection of their cattle from disease, and make thank-offerings of butter if these prayers are fulfilled.
Other pilgrims to Sing&#257;ji&#8217;s shrine offer unripe mangoes and sugar, and an annual fair is held at it, when it is said that
for seven days no cows, flies or ants are to be seen in the place. In the Bet&#363;l district there is a village godling called
Dait, represented by a stone under a tree. He is the spirit of any Ah&#299;r who in his lifetime was credited in the locality with
having the powers of an exorcist. In Mandla and other Districts when any buffalo herdsman dies at a very advanced <a id="d0e1656"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1656">31</a>]</span>age the people make a platform for him within the village and call it Mahashi Deo or the buffalo god. Similarly, when an old
cattle herdsman dies they do the same, and call it Balki Deo or the bullock god. Here we have a clear instance of the process
of substituting the spirit of the herdsman for the cow or buffalo as an object of worship. The occupation of the Ah&#299;r also
lends itself to religious imaginations. He stays in the forest or waste grass-land, frequently alone from morning till night,
watching his herds; and the credulous and uneducated minds of the more emotional may easily hear the voices of spirits, or
in a half-sleeping condition during the heat and stillness of the long day may think that visions have appeared to them. Thus
they come to believe themselves selected for communication with the unseen deities or spirits, and on occasions of strong
religious excitement work themselves into a frenzy and are held to be possessed by a spirit or god.

<h3>13. Caste deities.</h3>
<p>Among the special deities of the Ah&#299;rs is Kharak Deo, who is always located at the <i>khirkha</i>, or place of assembly of the cattle, on going to and returning from pasture. He appears to be the spirit or god of the <i>khirkha</i>. He is represented by a platform with an image of a horse on it, and when cattle fall ill the owners offer flour and butter
to him. These are taken by the Ah&#299;rs in charge, and it is thought that the cattle will get well. Matar Deo is the god of the
pen or enclosure for cattle made in the jungle. Three days after the Diw&#257;li festival the R&#257;wats sacrifice one or more goats
to him, cutting off their heads. They throw the heads into the air, and the cattle, smelling the blood, run together and toss
them with their horns as they do when they scent a tiger. The men then say that the animals are possessed by Matar Deo. Guraya
Deo is a deity who lives in the cattle-stalls in the village and is worshipped once a year. A man holds an egg in his hand,
and walks round the stall pouring liquid over the egg all the way, so as to make a line round it. The egg is then buried beneath
the shrine of the god, the rite being probably meant to ensure his aid for the protection of the cattle from disease in their
stalls. A favourite saint of the Ah&#299;rs is Harid&#257;s B&#257;ba. He was a Jogi, and could separate his soul from his body at pleasure.
On one occasion he had <a id="d0e1669"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1669">32</a>]</span>gone in spirit to Ben&#257;res, leaving his body in the house of one of his disciples, who was an Ah&#299;r. When he did not return,
and the people heard that a dead body was lying there, they came and insisted that it should be burnt. When he came back and
found that his body was burnt, he entered into a man and spoke through him, telling the people what had happened. In atonement
for their unfortunate mistake they promised to worship him.

<h3>14. Other deities.</h3>
<p>The Mah&#257;kul Ah&#299;rs of Jashpur have three deities, whom they call Mah&#257;deo or Siva, Sah&#257;deo, one of the five P&#257;ndava brothers,
and the goddess Lakshmi. They say that the buffalo is Mah&#257;deo, the cow Sah&#257;deo, and the rice Lakshmi. This also appears to
be an instance of the personification of animals and the corn into anthropomorphic deities.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1680">
<h3>15. The Diw&#257;li festival.</h3>
<p>The principal festival of the Ah&#299;rs is the Diw&#257;li, falling about the beginning of November, which is also the time when the
autumn crops ripen. All classes observe this feast by illuminating their houses with many small saucer-lamps and letting off
crackers and fireworks, and they generally gamble with money to bring them good luck during the coming year. The Ah&#299;rs make
a mound of earth, which is called Govardhan, that is the mountain in Mathura which Krishna held upside down on his finger
for seven days and nights, so that all the people might gather under it and be protected from the devastating storms of rain
sent by Indra. After dancing round the mound they drive their cattle over it and make them trample it to pieces. At this time
a festival called Marhai is held, at which much liquor is drunk and all classes disport themselves. In Damoh on this day the
Ah&#299;rs go to the standing-place for village cattle, and after worshipping the god, frighten the cattle by waving leaves of
the basil-plant at them, and then put on fantastic dresses, decorating themselves with cowries, and go round the village,
singing and dancing. Elsewhere at the time of the Marhai they dance round a pole with peacock feathers tied to the top, and
sometimes wear peacock feathers themselves, as well as aprons sewn all over with cowries. It is said that Krishna and Bal&#257;r&#257;m
used to wear peacock feathers when they danced in the jungles of Mathura, but this rite has probably some connection with
<a id="d0e1685"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1685">33</a>]</span>the worship of the peacock. This bird might be venerated by the Ah&#299;rs as one of the prominent denizens of the jungle. In Raipur
they tie a white cock to the top of the pole and dance round it. In Mandla, Khila Mutha, the god of the threshing-floor, is
worshipped at this time, with offerings of a fowl and a goat. They also perform the rite of <i>jag&#257;na</i> or waking him up. They tie branches of a small shrub to a stick and pour milk over the stone which is his emblem, and sing,
&#8216;Wake up, Khila Mutha, this is the night of Am&#257;was&#8217; (the new moon). Then they go to the cattle-shed and wake up the cattle,
crying, &#8216;Poraiya, god of the door, watchman of the window, open the door, N&#257;nd Gow&#257;l is coming.&#8217; Then they drive out the cattle
and chase them with the branches tied to their sticks as far as their grazing-ground. N&#257;nd Gow&#257;l was the foster-father of
Krishna, and is now said to signify a man who has a lakh (100,000) of cows. This custom of frightening the cattle and making
them run is called <i>dhor jag&#257;na</i> or <i>bichk&#257;na</i>, that is, to wake up or terrify the cattle. Its meaning is obscure, but it is said to preserve the cattle from disease during
the year. In Raipur the women make an image of a parrot in clay at the Diw&#257;li and place it on a pole and go round to the different
houses, singing and dancing round the pole, and receiving presents of rice and money. They praise the parrot as the bird who
carries messages from a lover to his mistress, and as living on the mountains and among the green verdure, and sing:

</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, parrot, where shall we sow <i>gondla</i> grass and where shall we sow rice?

</p>
<p>&#8220;We will sow <i>gondla</i> in a pond and rice in the field.

</p>
<p>&#8220;With what shall we cut <i>gondla</i> grass, and with what shall we cut rice?

</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall cut <i>gondla</i> with an axe and rice with a sickle.&#8221;

</p>
<p>It is probable that the parrot is revered as a spirit of the forest, and also perhaps because it is destructive to the corn.
The parrot is not, so far as is known, associated with any god, but the Hindus do not kill it. In Bil&#257;spur an ear of rice
is put into the parrot&#8217;s mouth, and it is said there that the object of the rite is to prevent the parrots from preying on
the corn.

<h3>16. Omens.</h3>
<p>On the night of the full moon of Jesth (May) the Ah&#299;rs stay awake all night, and if the moon is covered with clouds they think
that the rains will be good. If a cow&#8217;s horns are not firmly fixed in the head and seem to shake slightly, it is called Maini,
and such an animal is considered to be lucky. If a bullock sits down with three legs under him and the fourth stretched out
in front it is a very good omen, and it is thought that his master&#8217;s cattle will increase and multiply. When a buffalo-calf
is born they cover it at once with a black cloth and remove it from the mother&#8217;s sight, as they think that if she saw the
calf and it then died her milk would dry up. The calf is fed by hand. Cow-calves, on the other hand, are usually left with
the mother, and many people allow them to take all the milk, as they think it a sin to deprive them of it.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1725">
<h3>17. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The Ah&#299;rs will eat the flesh of goats and chickens, and most of them consume liquor freely. The Kaonra Ah&#299;rs of Mandla eat
pork, and the R&#257;wats of Chhatt&#299;sgarh are said not to object to field-mice and rats, even when caught in the houses. The Kaonra
Ah&#299;rs are also said not to consider a woman impure during the period of menstruation. Nevertheless the Ah&#299;rs enjoy a good
social status, owing to their relations with the sacred cow. As remarked by Eha: &#8220;His family having been connected for many
generations with the sacred animal he enjoys a certain consciousness of moral respectability, like a man whose uncles are
deans or canons.&#8221;<a id="d0e1730src" href="#d0e1730" class="noteref">15</a> All castes will take water from the hands of an Ah&#299;r, and in Chhatt&#299;sgarh and the Uriya country the R&#257;wats and Gahras, as
the Ah&#299;r caste is known respectively in these localities, are the only caste from whom Br&#257;hmans and all other Hindus will
take water. On this account, and because of their comparative purity, they are largely employed as personal servants. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh
the ordinary R&#257;wats will clean the cooking-vessels even of Muhammadans, but the Thethw&#257;r or pure R&#257;wats refuse this menial
work. In Mandla, when a man is to be brought back into caste after a serious offence, such as getting vermin in a wound, he
is made to stand in the middle of a stream, while some elderly relative pours water over him. <a id="d0e1734"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1734">35</a>]</span>He then addresses the members of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee, who are standing on the bank, saying to them, &#8216;Will you leave me in the mud or will you take me out?&#8217; Then
they tell him to come out, and he has to give a feast. At this a member of the Meliha sept first eats food and puts some into
the offender&#8217;s mouth, thus taking the latter&#8217;s sin upon himself. The offender then addresses the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> saying, &#8216;R&#257;jas of the Panch, eat.&#8217; Then the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> and all the caste take food with him and he is readmitted. In N&#257;ndgaon State the head of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> is known as Thethw&#257;r, the title of the highest subcaste, and is appointed by the R&#257;ja, to whom he makes a present. In Jashpur,
among the Mah&#257;kul Ah&#299;rs, when an offender is put out of caste he has on readmission to make an offering of Rs. 1&#8211;4 to B&#257;l&#257;ji,
the tutelary deity of the State. These Mah&#257;kuls desire to be considered superior to ordinary Ah&#299;rs, and their social rules
are hence very strict. A man is put out of caste if a dog, fowl or pig touches his water or cooking-pots, or if he touches
a fowl. In the latter case he is obliged to make an offering of a fowl to the local god, and eight days are allowed for procuring
it. A man is also put out of caste for beating his father. In Mandla, Ah&#299;rs commonly have the title of Patel or headman of
a village, probably because in former times, when the country consisted almost entirely of forest and grass land, they were
accustomed to hold large areas on contract for grazing.

<div class="div2" id="d0e1748">
<h3>18. Ornaments.</h3>
<p>In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the R&#257;wat women are especially fond of wearing large <i>churas</i> or leg-ornaments of bell-metal. These consist of a long cylinder which fits closely to the leg, being made in two halves
which lock into each other, while at each end and in the centre circular plates project outwards horizontally. A pair of these
<i>churas</i> may weigh 8 or 10 lbs., and cost from Rs. 3 to Rs. 9. It is probable that some important magical advantage was expected to
come from the wearing of these heavy appendages, which must greatly impede free progression, but its nature is not known.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1759">
<h3>19. Occupation.</h3>
<p>Only about thirty per cent of the Ah&#299;rs are still occupied in breeding cattle and dealing in milk and butter. About four per
cent are domestic servants, and nearly all the remainder cultivators and labourers. In former times the <a id="d0e1764"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1764">36</a>]</span>Ah&#299;rs had the exclusive right of milking the cow, so that on all occasions an Ah&#299;r must be hired for this purpose even by
the lowest castes. Any one could, however, milk the buffalo, and also make curds and other preparations from cow&#8217;s milk.<a id="d0e1766src" href="#d0e1766" class="noteref">16</a> This rule is interesting as showing how the caste system was maintained and perpetuated by the custom of preserving to each
caste a monopoly of its traditional occupation. The rule probably applied also to the bulk of the cultivating and the menial
and artisan castes, and now that it has been entirely abrogated it would appear that the gradual decay and dissolution of
the caste organisation must follow. The village cattle are usually entrusted jointly to one or more herdsmen for grazing purposes.
The grazier is paid separately for each animal entrusted to his care, a common rate being one anna for a cow or bullock and
two annas for a buffalo per month. When a calf is born he gets four annas for a cow-calf and eight annas for a she-buffalo,
but except in the rice districts nothing for a male buffalo-calf, as these animals are considered useless outside the rice
area. The reason is that buffaloes do not work steadily except in swampy or wet ground, where they can refresh themselves
by frequent drinking. In the northern Districts male buffalo-calves are often neglected and allowed to die, but the cow-buffaloes
are extremely valuable, because their milk is the principal source of supply of <i>gh&#299;</i> or boiled butter. When a cow or buffalo is in milk the grazier often gets the milk one day out of four or five. When a calf
is born the teats of the cow are first milked about twenty times on to the ground in the name of the local god of the Ah&#299;rs.
The remainder of the first day&#8217;s milk is taken by the grazier, and for the next few days it is given to friends. The village
grazier is often also expected to prepare the guest-house for Government officers and others visiting the village, fetch grass
for their animals, and clean their cooking vessels. For this he sometimes receives a small plot of land and a present of a
blanket annually from the village proprietor. M&#257;lguz&#257;rs and large tenants have their private herdsmen. The pasturage afforded
by the village waste lands and forest is, as a rule, only sufficient for the plough-bullocks <a id="d0e1774"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1774">37</a>]</span>and more valuable milch-animals. The remainder are taken away sometimes for long distances to the Government forest reserves,
and here the herdsmen make stockades in the jungle and remain there with their animals for months together. The cattle which
remain in the village are taken by the owners in the early morning to the <i>khirkha</i> or central standing-ground. Here the grazier takes them over and drives them out to pasture. He brings them back at ten or
eleven, and perhaps lets them stand in some field which the owner wants manured. Then he separates the cows and milch-buffaloes
and takes them to their masters&#8217; houses, where he milks them all. In the afternoon all the cattle are again collected and
driven out to pasture. The cultivators are very much in the grazier&#8217;s hands, as they cannot supervise him, and if dishonest
he may sell off a cow or calf to a friend in a distant village and tell the owner that it has been carried off by a tiger
or panther. Unless the owner succeeds by a protracted search or by accident in finding the animal he cannot disprove the herdsman&#8217;s
statement, and the only remedy is to dispense with the latter&#8217;s services if such losses become unduly frequent. On this account,
according to the proverbs, the Ah&#299;r is held to be treacherous and false to his engagements. They are also regarded as stupid
because they seldom get any education, retain their rustic and half-aboriginal dialect, and on account of their solitary life
are dull and slow-witted in company. &#8216;The barber&#8217;s son learns to shave on the Ah&#299;r&#8217;s head.&#8217; &#8216;The cow is in league with the
milkman and lets him milk water into the pail.&#8217; The Ah&#299;rs are also hot-tempered, and their propensity for drinking often results
in affrays, when they break each other&#8217;s head with their cattle-staffs. &#8216;A Gaoli&#8217;s quarrel: drunk at night and friends in
the morning.&#8217;

<h3>20. Preparations of milk.</h3>
<p>Hindus nearly always boil their milk before using it, as the taste of milk fresh from the cow is considered unpalatable. After
boiling, the milk is put in a pot and a little old curds added, when the whole becomes <i>dahi</i> or sour curds. This is a favourite food, and appears to be exactly the same substance as the Bulgarian sour milk which is
now considered to have much medicinal value. Butter is also made by churning these curds or <i>dahi</i>. Butter is never used <a id="d0e1790"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1790">38</a>]</span>without being boiled first, when it becomes converted into a sort of oil; this has the advantage of keeping much better than
fresh butter, and may remain fit for use for as long as a year. This boiled butter is known as <i>gh&#299;</i>, and is the staple product of the dairy industry, the bulk of the surplus supply of milk being devoted to its manufacture.
It is freely used by all classes who can afford it, and serves very well for cooking purposes. There is a comparatively small
market for fresh milk among the Hindus, and as a rule only those drink milk who obtain it from their own animals. The acid
residue after butter has been made from <i>dahi</i> (curds) or milk is known as <i>matha</i> or butter-milk, and is the only kind of milk drunk by the poorer classes. Milk boiled so long as to become solidified is
known as <i>kh&#299;r</i>, and is used by confectioners for making sweets. When the milk is boiled and some sour milk added to it, so that it coagulates
while hot, the preparation is called <i>chhana</i>. The whey is expressed from this by squeezing it in a cloth, and a kind of cheese is obtained.<a id="d0e1807src" href="#d0e1807" class="noteref">17</a> The liquid which oozes out at the root of a cow&#8217;s horns after death is known as <i>gaolochan</i> and sells for a high price, as it is considered a valuable medicine for children&#8217;s cough and lung diseases.

</span><h2>Andh</h2>
<p><b>Andh.</b><a id="d0e1822src" href="#d0e1822" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A low cultivating caste of Ber&#257;r, who numbered 52,000 persons in 1911, and belong to the Yeotmal, Akola and Buld&#257;na Districts.
The Andhs appear to be a non-Aryan tribe of the Andhra or Tamil country, from which they derive their name. The territories
of the Andhra dynasty extended across southern India from sea to sea in the early part of the Christian era. This designation
may, however, have been given to them after migration, emigrants being not infrequently called in their new country by the
name of the place from which they came, as Ber&#257;ri, Purdesi, Audhia (from Oudh), and so on. At present there seems to be no
caste called Andh in Madras. Mr. Kitts<a id="d0e1825src" href="#d0e1825" class="noteref">2</a> notes that they still come from Hyder&#257;b&#257;d across the Penganga river.
<a id="d0e1830"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1830">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>The caste are divided into two groups, Vart&#257;ti or pure and Khalt&#257;ti or illegitimate, which take food together, but do not
intermarry. They have a large number of exogamous septs, most of which appear to have Mar&#257;thi names, either taken from villages
or of a titular character. A few are called after animals or plants, as M&#257;jiria the cat, Ringni a kind of tree, Dumare from
Dumar, an ant-hill, Dukare from Dukar, a pig, and Titawe from Titawa, a bird. B&#257;ghm&#257;re means tiger-killer or one killed by
a tiger; members of this sept revere the tiger. Two septs, Bhoyar and Wanj&#257;ri, are named after other castes.

</p>
<p>Marriage between members of the same sept is prohibited, and also between first cousins, except that a sister&#8217;s son may marry
a brother&#8217;s daughter. Until recently marriage has been adult, but girls are now wedded as children, and betrothals are sometimes
arranged before they are born. The ceremony resembles that of the Kunbis. Betrothals are arranged between October and December,
and the weddings take place three or four months later, from January to April. If the bride is mature she goes at once to
her husband&#8217;s house. Polygamy is allowed; and as only a well-to-do man can afford to obtain more than one wife, those who
have several are held to be wealthy, and treated with respect. Divorce and the remarriage of widows are permitted, but the
widow may not marry her husband&#8217;s brother nor any member of his clan. If an unmarried girl becomes pregnant by a man of her
own or a superior caste she is fined, and can then be married as a widow. Her feet are not washed nor besmeared with red powder
at the wedding ceremony like those of other girls. In some localities Andh women detected in a criminal intimacy even with
men of such impure castes as the Mah&#257;rs and M&#257;ngs have been readmitted into the community. A substantial fine is imposed on
a woman detected in adultery according to her means and spent on a feast to the caste. All the members thus have a personal
interest in the detection and punishment of such offences. The dead are usually buried, and water and sugar are placed in
a dying man&#8217;s mouth instead of the sacred objects used by Hindus; nor are the dying urged to call on R&#257;ma. The dead are buried
with the head to the south, <a id="d0e1835"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1835">40</a>]</span>in opposition to the Hindu custom. The Andhs will eat the flesh of fowls and pigs, and even cats, rats and snakes in some
localities, though the more civilised have abjured these latter. They are very fond of pork, and drink liquor, and will take
food from Kunbis, M&#257;lis and Kolis, but not from Gonds. They have a caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee, with a headman called Mohtaria, and two officers known as Phopatia and Dukria. When a caste offence is committed
the Dukria goes to call the offender, and is given the earthen pots used at the penalty-feast, while the Phopatia receives
a new piece of cloth. The Mohtaria or headman goes from village to village to decide cases, and gets a share of the fine.
The caste are <i>shik&#257;ris</i> or hunters, and cultivators. They catch antelope, hares, pig and nilgai in their nets, and kill them with sticks and stones,
and they dam up streams and net fish. Birds are not caught. Generally, the customs of the Andhs clearly point to an aboriginal
origin, but they are rapidly being Hinduised, and in some tracts can scarcely be distinguished from Kunbis.

</p>
<p>They have Mar&#257;thi names; and though only one name is given at birth, Mr. Slaney notes that this is frequently changed for
some pet name, and as often as not a man goes regularly by some name other than his real one.

</span><h2>Arakh</h2>
<p><b>Arakh.</b>&#8212;A small caste of cultivators and labourers found principally in the Ch&#257;nda District and Ber&#257;r and scattered over other localities.
The Arakhs are considered to be an offshoot of the P&#257;si or Bahelia caste of hunters and fowlers. Mr. Crooke<a id="d0e1852src" href="#d0e1852" class="noteref">1</a> writes of them: &#8220;All their traditions connect them with the P&#257;sis and Parasur&#257;ma, the sixth Avat&#257;ra of Vishnu. One story
runs that Parasur&#257;ma was bathing in the sea, when a leech bit his foot and caused it to bleed. He divided the blood into two
parts; out of one part he made the first P&#257;si and out of the second the first Arakh. Another story is that the P&#257;sis were
made out of the sweat (<i>pas&#299;na</i>) of Parasur&#257;ma. While Parasur&#257;ma was away the P&#257;si shot some animals with his bow, and the deity was so enraged that he cursed
the P&#257;si, and swore that his descendants should keep pigs. This accounts <a id="d0e1860"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1860">41</a>]</span>for the degradation of the P&#257;sis. Subsequently Parasur&#257;ma sent for some P&#257;sis to help him in one of his wars; but they ran
away and hid in an <i>arhar</i><a id="d0e1864src" href="#d0e1864" class="noteref">2</a> field and were hence called Arakhs.&#8221; This connection with the P&#257;sis is also recognised in the case of the Arakhs of Ber&#257;r,
of whom Mr. Kitts writes:<a id="d0e1868src" href="#d0e1868" class="noteref">3</a> &#8220;The Arakhs found in Morsi are a race akin to the Bahelias. Their regular occupation is bird-catching and <i>shik&#257;r</i> (hunting). They do not follow Hindu customs in their marriages, but although they keep pigs, eat flesh and drink spirits,
they will not touch a Cham&#257;r. They appear to be a branch of the P&#257;si tribe, and are described as a semi-Hinduised class of
aborigines.&#8221; In the Ch&#257;nda District, however, the Arakhs are closely connected with the Gond tribe, as is evident from their
system of exogamy. Thus they say that they are divided into the M&#257;tia, Tek&#257;m, Tesli, God&#257;m, Madai, Say&#257;m and Chorliu septs,
worshipping respectively three, four, five, six, seven, eight and twelve gods; and persons who worship the same number of
gods cannot marry with one another. This system of divisions according to the different number of gods worshipped is found
in the Central Provinces only among the Gonds and one or two other tribes like the Baigas, who have adopted it from them,
and as some of the names given above are also Gondi words, no doubt need be entertained that the Arakhs of Ch&#257;nda are largely
of Gond descent. They are probably, in fact, the offspring of irregular connections between the Gonds and P&#257;sis, who, being
both frequenters of the forests, would naturally come much into contact with each other. And being disowned by the true P&#257;sis
on account of their defective pedigree, they have apparently set up as a separate caste and adopted the name of Arakh to hide
the deficiencies of their ancestry.

</p>
<p>The social customs of the Arakhs resemble those of other low Hindu castes, and need not be given in detail. Their weddings
are held near a temple of M&#257;roti, or if there be none such, then at the place where the Holi fire was lit in the preceding
year. A bride-price varying from Rs. 25 to Rs. 40 is usually paid. In the case of the <a id="d0e1878"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1878">42</a>]</span>marriage of a widow, the second husband goes to the house of the woman, where the couple are bathed and seated on two wooden
boards, a branch of a cotton-plant being placed near them. The bridegroom then ties five strings of black glass beads round
the woman&#8217;s neck. The dead are mourned for one day only, and a funeral feast is given to the caste-fellows. The Arakhs are
a very low caste, but their touch does not convey impurity.

</span><h2>At&#257;ri</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1883">
<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>At&#257;ri,<a id="d0e1889src" href="#d0e1889" class="noteref">1</a> Gandhi, <span id="d0e1892" class="corr" title="Source: Bukekari">Bukek&#257;ri</span>.</b>&#8212;A small Muhammadan caste of retailers of scent, incense, tooth-powder and <i>kunku</i> or pink powder. At&#257;ri is derived from <i>atar</i> or <i>itra</i>, attar of roses. Gandhi comes from <i>gandh</i>, a Sanskrit word for scent. Bukek&#257;ri is a Mar&#257;thi word meaning a seller of powder. The At&#257;ris number about two hundred persons
in N&#257;gpur, Wardha and Ber&#257;r. Both Hindus and Muhammadans follow the profession, but the Hindu At&#257;ris are not a separate caste,
and belong to the Teli, Gurao and Beld&#257;r castes. The Muhammadan At&#257;ris, to whom this article refers, may marry with other
Muhammadans, with the exception of low-class tradesmen like the Pinj&#257;ras, Kasais and Kunjras. One instance of an At&#257;ri marrying
a Rangrez is known, but usually they decline to do so. But since they are not considered to be the equals of ordinary Muhammadans,
they constitute more or less a distinct social group. They are of the same position as Muhammadan tin-workers, bangle-makers
and pedlars, and sometimes intermarry with them. They admit Hindu converts into the community, but the women refuse to eat
with them, and the better-class families will not intermarry with converts. A new convert must be circumcised, but if he is
of advanced age, or if his foreskin is wanting, as sometimes happens, they take a rolled-up betel-leaf and cut it in two in
substitution for the rite.

<div class="div2" id="d0e1908">
<h3>2. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>It is essential that a girl should be married before adolescence, as it is said that when the signs of puberty appear in her
before wedlock her parents commit a crime equivalent to the shedding of human blood. The father <a id="d0e1913"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1913">43</a>]</span>of the boy looks for a bride, and after dropping hints to the girl&#8217;s family to see if his proposal is acceptable, he sends
some female relatives or friends to discuss the marriage. Before the wedding the boy is presented with a <i>chh&#257;p</i> or ring of gold or silver with a small cup-like attachment. A <i>mehar</i> or dowry must be given to the bride, the amount of which is not below Rs. 50 or above Rs. 250. The bride&#8217;s parents give her
cooking vessels, bedding and a bedstead. After the wedding, the couple are seated on a cot while the women sing songs, and
they see each other&#8217;s face reflected in a mirror. The procession returns after a stay of four days, and is received by the
women of the bridegroom&#8217;s family with some humorous ceremonies bearing on the nature of marriage. A feast called T&#257;mm Wal&#299;ma
follows, and the couple are shut up together in an inner room, even though they may be under age. The marriage includes some
Hindu customs, such as the erection of the <i>pandal</i> or shed, rubbing the couple with turmeric and oil, and the tying on of <i>kankans</i> or wrist-bands. A girl going wrong before marriage may be wedded with full rites so long as she has not conceived, but after
conception until her child is born she cannot go through the ceremony at all. After the birth of the child she may be married
simply with the rite for widows. She retains the child, but it has no claim to succeed to her husband&#8217;s property. A widow
may marry again after an interval of forty days from her first husband&#8217;s death, and she may wed her younger brother-in-law.
Divorce is permitted at the instance of either party, and for mere disagreement. A man usually divorces his wife by vowing
in the presence of two witnesses that he will in future consider intercourse with her as incestuous in the same degree as
with his mother. A divorced woman has a claim to her <i>mehar</i> or dowry if not already paid, but forfeits it if she marries again. A man can marry the daughter of his paternal uncle. The
services of a K&#257;zi at weddings are paid for with a fee of Rs. 1&#8211;4, and well-to-do persons also give him a pair of turbans.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1930">
<h3>3. Religion.</h3>
<p>The At&#257;ris are Muhammadans of the Sunn&#299; sect. They revere the Muhammadan saints, and on the night of Shabr&#257;t they let off
fireworks in honour of their ancestors and make <a id="d0e1935"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1935">44</a>]</span>offerings of <i>halwa</i><a id="d0e1939src" href="#d0e1939" class="noteref">2</a> to them and place lamps and scent on their tombs. They swear by the pig and abstain from eating its flesh. The dog is considered
an unclean animal and its tail, ears and tongue are especially defiling. If the hair of a dog falls on the ground they cannot
pray in that place because the souls of the prophets cannot come there. To see a dog flapping its ears is a bad omen, and
a person starting on a journey should postpone his departure. They esteem the spider, because they say it spread its web over
the mouth of the cave where Hasan and Husain lay concealed from their enemies and thus prevented it from being searched. Some
of them have P&#299;rs or spiritual preceptors, these being Muhammadan beggars, not necessarily celibate. The ceremony of adhesion
is that a man should drink sherbet from the cup from which his preceptor has drunk. They do not observe impurity after a death
nor bathe on returning from a funeral.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1942">
<h3>4. Social customs.</h3>
<p>Liquor is of course prohibited to the At&#257;ris as to other Muhammadans, but some of them drink it nevertheless. Some of them
eat beef and others abstain. The blood of animals killed must flow before death according to the rite of <i>hal&#257;l</i>, but they say that fish are an exception, because when Abraham was offering up his son Ishmael and God substituted a goat,
the goat bleated before it was killed, and this offended Abraham, who threw his sacrificial knife into the sea: the knife
struck and killed a fish, and on this account all fish are considered to be <i>hal&#257;l</i> or lawful food without any further rite. The At&#257;ris observe the Hindu law of inheritance, and some of them worship Hindu
deities, as M&#257;ta the goddess of smallpox. As a rule their women are not secluded. The At&#257;ris make <i>missi</i> or tooth-powder from myrobalans, cloves and cardamoms, and other constituents. This has the effect of blackening the teeth.
They also sell the <i>kunku</i> or red powder which women rub on their foreheads, its constituents being turmeric, borax and the juice of limes. They sell
scent and sometimes deal in tobacco. The scents most in demand are <i>gul&#257;b-p&#257;ni</i> or rose-water and <i>phulel</i> or essence of tilli or sesamum. Scents are usually sold by the tola of 18 annas silver weight,<a id="d0e1965src" href="#d0e1965" class="noteref">3</a> and <a id="d0e1968"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1968">45</a>]</span>a tola of attar may vary in price from 8 annas to Rs. 80. Other scents are made from <i>khas-khas</i> grass, the mango, henna and musk, the <i>bela</i> flower,<a id="d0e1976src" href="#d0e1976" class="noteref">4</a> the champak<a id="d0e1980src" href="#d0e1980" class="noteref">5</a> and cucumber. Scent is manufactured by distillation from the flowers boiled in water, and the drops of congealed vapour fall
into sandalwood oil, which they say is the basis of all scents. Fragrant oils are also sold for rubbing on the hair, made
from orange flowers, jasmine, cotton-seed and the flowers of the <i>aonla</i> tree.<a id="d0e1987src" href="#d0e1987" class="noteref">6</a> Scent is sold in tiny circular glass bottles, and the oils in little bottles made from thin leather. The At&#257;ris also retail
the little black sticks of incense which are set up and burnt at the time of taking food and in temples, so that the smell
and smoke may keep off evil spirits. When professional exorcists are called upon to clear any building, such as a hospital,
supposed to be haunted by spirits or the ghosts of the dead, they commence operations by placing these sticks of incense at
the entrance and setting them alight as in a temple.

</span><h2>Audhelia</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e1994">
<h3>1. Origin.</h3>
<p><b>Audhelia (Audhalia).</b>&#8212;A small hybrid caste found almost exclusively in the Bil&#257;spur District, where they number about 1000 persons. The name is
derived from the word Udharia, meaning a person with clandestine sexual intimacies. The Audhelias are a mixed caste and trace
their origin from a Daharia R&#257;jp&#363;t ancestor, by one Bh&#363;ri B&#257;ndi, a female slave of unknown caste. This couple is supposed
to have resided in Ratanpur, the old capital of Chhatt&#299;sgarh, and the female ancestors of the Audhelias are said to have been
prostitutes until they developed into a caste and began to marry among themselves. Their proper avocation at present is the
rearing of pigs, while some of them are also tenants and farm-labourers. Owing to the base descent and impure occupation of
the caste they are held in very low esteem, and their touch is considered to convey pollution.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2001">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>The caste have at present no endogamous divisions and still admit members of other castes with the exception of the very lowest.
But social gradations exist to a certain <a id="d0e2006"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2006">46</a>]</span>extent among the members according to the position of their male ancestors, a Daharia Audhelia, for instance, being reluctant
to eat or intermarry with a Panka Audhelia. Under these circumstances it has become a rule among the Audhelias not to eat
with their caste-fellows excepting their own relations. On the occasion of a caste feast, therefore, each guest prepares his
own food, taking only uncooked grain from his host. At present seven <i>gotras</i> or exogamous divisions appear to have been formed in the caste with the names of Pachbhaiya, Chhahri, K&#257;lkhor, Bachh&#257;wat,
Dhan&#257;wat, Bhainsa and Limu&#257;n. The following story exists as to the origin of these <i>gotras</i>: There were formerly three brothers, Sahasm&#257;n, Budha and Mangal, who were S&#257;nsis or robbers. One evening the three brothers
halted in a forest and went to look for food. One brought back a buffalo-horn, another a peacock&#8217;s feather and the youngest,
Mangal, brought plums. The other brothers asked Mangal to let them share his plums, to which he agreed on condition that one
of the brothers should give his daughter to him in marriage. As Mangal and his brothers were of one <i>gotra</i> or section, and the marriage would thus involve splitting up the <i>gotra</i>, the brothers were doubtful whether it could be performed. They sought about for some sign to determine this difficult question,
and decided that if Mangal succeeded in breaking in pieces an iron image of a cat simply by blows of his naked fist, it would
be a sufficient indication that they might split up their <i>gotra</i>. Mangal was therefore put to the ordeal and succeeded in breaking the image, so the three brothers split up their <i>gotra</i>, the eldest assuming the <i>gotra</i> name of Bhainsa because he had found a buffalo-horn, the second that of K&#257;lkhor, which is stated to mean peacock, and the
third that of Chhahri, which at any rate does not mean a plum. The word Chhahri means either &#8216;shadow,&#8217; or &#8216;one who washes
the clothes of a woman in confinement.&#8217; If we assume it to have the latter meaning, it may be due to the fact that Mangal
had to wash the clothes of his own wife, not being able to induce a professional washerman to do so on account of the incestuous
nature of the connection. As the eldest brother gave his daughter in an incestuous marriage he was also degraded, and became
the ancestor <a id="d0e2029"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2029">47</a>]</span>of the Kanjars or prostitutes, who, it is said, to the present day do not solicit Audhelias in consideration of the consanguinity
existing between them. The story itself sufficiently indicates the low and mixed descent of the Audhelias, and its real meaning
may possibly be that when they first began to form a separate caste they permitted incestuous marriages on account of the
paucity of their members. A curious point about the story is that the incestuous nature of the connection is not taken to
be the most pressing objection to the marriage of Mangal with his own niece, but the violation of the caste rule prohibiting
marriage within the same <i>gotra</i>. Bachh&#257;wat and Dhan&#257;wat are the names of sections of the Banj&#257;ra caste, and the persons of these <i>gotras</i> among the Audhelias are probably the descendants of illicit connections among Banj&#257;ras. The word Pachbhaiya means &#8216;five brothers,&#8217;
and this name possibly commemorates a polyandrous connection of some Audhelia woman. Limu&#257;n means a tortoise, which is a section
of many castes. Several of the section-names are thus totemistic, and, as in other castes, some reverence is paid to the animal
from whom the name is derived. At present the Audhelias forbid marriage within the same <i>gotra</i> and also the union of first cousins. Girls are married between five and seven years of age as their numbers are scarce, and
they are engaged as early as possible. Unless weddings are arranged by exchanging girls between two families, a high bride-price,
often amounting to as much as Rs. 60, is paid. No stigma is incurred, however, if a girl should remain unmarried till she
arrives at adolescence, but, on the contrary, a higher price is then obtained for her. Sexual licence either before or after
marriage is considered a venial offence, but a woman detected in a <i>liaison</i> with a man of one of the lowest castes is turned out of caste. Widow marriage and divorce are freely allowed.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2043">
<h3>3. Religion, birth and death.</h3>
<p>The Audhelias venerate Dulha Deo and Devi, to whom they usually offer pigs. Their principal festival is the Holi, at which
their women were formerly engaged to perform as professional dancers. They usually burn their dead and remove the ashes on
the third day, throwing them into the nearest stream. A few of the bones are picked up and <a id="d0e2048"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2048">48</a>]</span>buried under a p&#299;pal tree, and a pitcher with a hole in the bottom is hung on the tree so that water may trickle down on to
them. On the tenth day the caste-people assemble and are shaved and bathe and rub their bodies with oil under the tree. Unmarried
men and persons dying of cholera are buried, the head being placed to the north. They consider that if they place the corpse
in the reverse position it would be an insult to the Ganges equivalent to kicking the holy river, as the feet of the body
would then be turned towards it.

<h3>1. Introductory notice.</h3>
<p><b>Badhak, B&#257;gri, Baoria.</b>&#8212;A famous tribe of dacoits who flourished up to about 1850, and extended their depredations over the whole of Northern and
Central India. The B&#257;gris and Baorias or B&#257;warias still exist and are well known to the police as inveterate criminals; but
their operations are now confined to ordinary burglary, theft and cheating, and their more interesting profession of armed
gang-robbery on a large scale is a thing of the past. The first part of this article is entirely compiled from the Report
on their suppression drawn up by Colonel Sleeman,<a id="d0e2149src" href="#d0e2149" class="noteref">1</a> who may be regarded as the virtual founder of the Thuggee and Dacoity Department. Some mention of the existing B&#257;gri and
Baoria tribes is added at the end.

<div class="div2" id="d0e2154">
<h3>2. The Badhak dacoits.</h3>
<p>The origin of the Badhaks is obscure, but they seem to have belonged to Gujar&#257;t, as their peculiar dialect, still in use,
is a form of Gujar&#257;ti. The most striking feature in it is the regular substitution of <i>kh</i> for <i>s</i>. They claimed to be <a id="d0e2165"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2165">50</a>]</span>R&#257;jp&#363;ts and were divided into clans with the well-known R&#257;jp&#363;t names of Solanki, Panw&#257;r, Dhundhel, Chauh&#257;n, R&#257;thor, Gahlot,
Bhatti and Ch&#257;ran. Their ancestors were supposed to have fled from Chitor on one of the historical occasions on which it was
assaulted and sacked. But as they spoke Gujar&#257;ti it seems more probable that they belonged to Gujar&#257;t, a fertile breeding-place
of criminals, and they may have been descended from the alliances of R&#257;jp&#363;ts with the primitive tribes of this locality, the
Bh&#299;ls and Kolis. The existing B&#257;gris are of short stature, one writer stating that none of them exceed five feet two inches
in height; and this seems to indicate that they have little R&#257;jp&#363;t blood. It may be surmised that the Badhaks rose into importance
and found scope for their predatory instincts during the period of general disorder and absence of governing authority through
which northern India passed after the decline of the Mughal Empire. And they lived and robbed with the connivance or open
support of the petty chiefs and landholders, to whom they gave a liberal share of their booty. The principal bands were located
in the Oudh forests, but they belonged to the whole of northern India including the Central Provinces; and as Colonel Sleeman&#8217;s
Report, though of much interest, is now practically unknown, I have thought it not out of place to compile an article by means
of short extracts from his account of the tribe.

</p>
<p>In 1822 the operations of the Badhaks were being conducted on such a scale that an officer wrote: &#8220;No District between the
Brahmaputra, the Nerbudda, the Satlej and the Himalayas is free from them; and within this vast field hardly any wealthy merchant
or manufacturer could feel himself secure for a single night from the depredations of Badhak dacoits. They had successfully
attacked so many of the treasuries of our native Sub-Collectors that it was deemed necessary, all over the North-Western Provinces,
to surround such buildings with extensive fortifications. In many cases they carried off our public treasure from strong parties
of our regular troops and mounted police; and none seemed to know whence they came or whither they fled with the booty acquired.&#8221;<a id="d0e2169src" href="#d0e2169" class="noteref">2</a>

<div class="div2" id="d0e2174">
<h3>3. Instances of dacoities.</h3>
<p>Colonel Sleeman thus described a dacoity in the town of Narsinghpur when he was in charge of that District:<a id="d0e2179src" href="#d0e2179" class="noteref">3</a> &#8220;In February 1822, in the dusk of the evening, a party of about thirty persons, with nothing seemingly but walking-sticks
in their hands, passed the piquet of sepoys on the bank of the rivulet which separates the cantonment from the town of Narsinghpur.
On being challenged by the sentries they said they were cowherds and that their cattle were following close behind. They walked
up the street; and coming opposite the houses of the most wealthy merchants, they set their torches in a blaze by blowing
suddenly on pots filled with combustibles, stabbed everybody who ventured to move or make the slightest noise, plundered the
houses, and in ten minutes were away with their booty, leaving about twelve persons dead and wounded on the ground. No trace
of them was discovered.&#8221; Another well-known exploit of the Badhaks was the attack on the palace of the ex-Peshwa, B&#257;ji Rao,
at Bith&#363;r near Cawnpore. This was accomplished by a gang of about eighty men, who proceeded to the locality in the disguise
of carriers of Ganges water. Having purchased a boat and a few muskets to intimidate the guard they crossed the Ganges about
six miles below Bith&#363;r, and reached the place at ten o&#8217;clock at night; and after wounding eighteen persons who attempted resistance
they possessed themselves of property, chiefly in gold, to the value of more than two and a half lakhs of rupees; and retiring
without loss made their way in safety to their homes in the Oudh forests. The residence of this gang was known to a British
police officer in the King of Oudh&#8217;s service, Mr. Orr, and after a long delay on the part of the court an expedition was sent
which recovered a portion of the treasure and captured two or three hundred of the Badhaks. But none of the recovered property
reached the hands of B&#257;ji Rao and the prisoners were soon afterwards released.<a id="d0e2182src" href="#d0e2182" class="noteref">4</a> Again in 1839, a gang of about fifty men under a well-known leader, Gajr&#257;j, scaled the walls of Jh&#257;nsi and plundered the
Sur&#257;fa or bankers&#8217; quarter of the town for two hours, obtaining booty to the value of Rs. 40,000, which they carried off without
the loss of a man. The following <a id="d0e2185"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2185">52</a>]</span>account of this raid was obtained by Colonel Sleeman from one of the robbers:<a id="d0e2187src" href="#d0e2187" class="noteref">5</a> &#8220;The spy (<i>hirrowa</i>) having returned and reported that he had found a merchant&#8217;s house in Jh&#257;nsi which contained a good deal of property, we
proceeded to a grove where we took the auspices by the process of <i>ak&#363;t</i> (counting of grains) and found the omens favourable. We then rested three days and settled the rates according to which the
booty should be shared. Four or five men, who were considered too feeble for the enterprise, were sent back, and the rest,
well armed, strong and full of courage, went on. In the evening of the fourth day we reached a plain about a mile from the
town, where we rested to take breath for an hour; about nine o&#8217;clock we got to the wall and remained under it till midnight,
preparing the ladders from materials which we had collected on the road. They were placed to the wall and we entered and passed
through the town without opposition. A marriage procession was going on before us and the people thought we belonged to it.
We found the bankers&#8217; shops closed. Th&#257;na and Saldewa, who carried the axes, soon broke them open, while Kulean lighted up
his torch. Gajr&#257;j with twenty men entered, while the rest stood posted at the different avenues leading to the place. When
all the property they could find had been collected, Gajr&#257;j hailed the god Hanum&#257;n and gave orders for the retreat. We got
back safely to Mondegri in two days and a half, and then reposed for two or three days with the R&#257;ja of Narwar, with whom
we left five or six of our stoutest men as a guard, and then returned home with our booty, consisting chiefly of diamonds,
emeralds, gold and silver bullion, rupees and about sixty pounds of silver wire. None of our people were either killed or
wounded, but whether any of the bankers&#8217; people were I know not.&#8221;

<h3>4. Further instances of dacoities.</h3>
<p>Colonel Sleeman writes elsewhere<a id="d0e2201src" href="#d0e2201" class="noteref">6</a> of the leader of the above exploit: &#8220;This Gajr&#257;j had risen from the vocation of a <i>bandarw&#257;la</i> (monkey showman) to be the Robin Hood of Gw&#257;lior and the adjacent States; he was the governor-general of banditti in that
country of banditti and kept the whole in awe; he had made himself so formidable that <a id="d0e2207"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2207">53</a>]</span>the Durbar appointed him to keep the <i>gh&#257;ts</i> or ferries over the Chambal, which he did in a very profitable manner to them and to himself, and none entered or quitted
the country without paying blackmail.&#8221; A common practice of the Badhaks, when in need of a little ready money, was to lie
in wait for money-changers on their return from the markets. These men take their bags of money with them to the important
baz&#257;rs at a distance from their residence and return home with them after dusk. The dacoits were accustomed to watch for them
in the darkest and most retired places on the roads and fell them to the ground with their bludgeons. This device was often
practised and usually succeeded.<a id="d0e2212src" href="#d0e2212" class="noteref">7</a> Of another Badhak chief, Meherb&#257;n, it is stated<a id="d0e2215src" href="#d0e2215" class="noteref">8</a> that he hired a discharged sepoy to instruct his followers in the European system of drill, that they might travel with him
in the disguise of regular soldiers, well armed and accoutred. During the rains Meherb&#257;n&#8217;s spies (<i>hirrowa</i>) were sent to visit the great commercial towns and report any despatches of money or other valuables, which were to take
place during the following open season. His own favourite disguise was that of a Hindu prince, while the remainder of the
gang constituted his retinue and escort. On one occasion, assuming this character, he followed up a boat laden with Spanish
dollars which was being sent from Calcutta to Ben&#257;res; and having attacked it at its moorings at Makrai, he killed one and
wounded ten men of the guard and made off with 25,000 Spanish dollars and Rs. 2600 of the Company&#8217;s coinage. A part of the
band were sent direct to the rendezvous previously arranged, while Meherb&#257;n returned to the grove where he had left his women
and proceeded with them in a more leisurely fashion to the same place. Retaining the character of a native prince he halted
here for two days to celebrate the Holi festival. Marching thence with his women conveyed in covered litters by hired bearers
who were changed at intervals, he proceeded to his bivouac in the Oudh forests; and at Seos&#257;gar, one of his halting-places,
he gave a large sum of money to a gardener to plant a grove of mango trees near a tank for the benefit of travellers, in the
name of R&#257;ja Meherb&#257;n Singh of Gaur <a id="d0e2221"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2221">54</a>]</span>in Oudh; and promised him further alms on future occasions of pilgrimage if he found the work progressing well, saying that
it was a great shame that travellers should be compelled as he had been to halt without shade for themselves or their families
during the heat of the day. He arrived safely at his quarters in the forest and was received in the customary fashion by a
procession of women in their best attire, who conducted him with dancing and music, like a victorious Roman Proconsul, to
his fort.<a id="d0e2223src" href="#d0e2223" class="noteref">9</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2226">
<h3>5. Disguise of religious mendicants.</h3>
<p>But naturally not all the Badhaks could do things in the style of Meherb&#257;n Singh. The disguise which they most often assumed
in the north was that of carriers of Ganges water, while in Central India they often pretended to be Banj&#257;ras travelling with
pack-bullocks, or pilgrims, or wedding-parties going to fetch the bride or bridegroom. Sometimes also they took the character
of religious mendicants, the leader being the high priest and all the rest his followers and disciples. One such gang, described
by Colonel Sleeman,<a id="d0e2231src" href="#d0e2231" class="noteref">10</a> had four or five tents of white and dyed cloth, two or three pairs of <i>nakk&#257;ras</i> or kettle-drums and trumpets, with a great number of buffaloes, cows, goats, sheep and ponies. Some were clothed, but the
bodies of the greater part were covered with nothing but ashes, paint and a small cloth waistband. But they always provided
themselves with five or six real Bair&#257;gis, whose services they purchased at a very high price. These men were put forward
to answer questions in case of difficulty and to bully the landlords and peasantry; and if the people demurred to the demands
of the Badhaks, to intimidate them by tricks calculated to play upon the fears of the ignorant. They held in their hands a
preparation of gunpowder resembling common ashes; and when they found the people very stubborn they repeated their <i>mantras</i> over this and threw it upon the thatch of the nearest house, to which it set fire. The explosion was caused by a kind of
fusee held in the hand which the people could not see, and taking it for a miracle they paid all that was demanded. Another
method was to pretend to be carrying the bones of dead relatives to the Ganges. The bones or ashes of <a id="d0e2240"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2240">55</a>]</span>the deceased, says<a id="d0e2242src" href="#d0e2242" class="noteref">11</a> Colonel Sleeman, are carried to the Ganges in bags, coloured red for females and white for males. These bags are considered
holy, and are not allowed to touch the ground upon the way, and during halts in the journey are placed on poles or triangles.
The carriers are regarded with respect as persons engaged upon a pious duty, and seldom questioned on the road. When a gang
assumed this disguise they proceeded to their place of rendezvous in small parties, some with red and some with white bags,
in which they carried the bones of animals most resembling those of the human frame. These were supported on triangles formed
of the shafts on which the spear-heads would be fitted when they reached their destination and had prepared for action.

<div class="div2" id="d0e2245">
<h3>6. Countenance and support of landowners.</h3>
<p>It would have been impossible for the Badhaks to exist and flourish as they did without the protection of the landowners on
whose estates they lived; and this they received in full measure in return for a liberal share of their booty. When the chief
of Karauli was called upon to dislodge a gang within his territory, he expressed apprehension that the coercion of the Badhaks
might cause a revolution in the State. He was not at all singular, says Colonel Sleeman, in his fear of exasperating this
formidable tribe of robbers. It was common to all the smaller chiefs and the provincial governors of the larger ones. They
everywhere protected and fostered the Badhaks, as did the landholders; and the highest of them associated with the leaders
of gangs on terms of equality and confidence. It was very common for a chief or the governor of a district in times of great
difficulty and personal danger to require from one of the leaders of such gangs a night-guard or <i>palang ki chauki</i>: and no less so to entertain large bodies of them in the attack and defence of forts and camps whenever unusual courage and
skill were required. The son of the R&#257;ja of Charda exchanged turbans with a Badhak leader, Mangal Singh, as a mark of the
most intimate friendship. This episode recalls an alliance of similar character in <i>Lorna Doone</i>; and indeed it would not be difficult to find several points of resemblance between the careers of the more enterprising
Badhak leaders and the <a id="d0e2256"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2256">56</a>]</span>Doones of Bagworthy; but India produced no character on the model of John Ridd, and it was reserved for an Englishman, Colonel
Sleeman, to achieve the suppression of the Badhaks as well as that of the Thugs. After the fortress and territory of Garh&#257;kota
in Saugor had been taken by the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Sindhia, Z&#257;lim Singh, a cousin of the dispossessed Bundela chief, collected a force
of Bundelas and Pind&#257;ris and ravaged the country round Garh&#257;kota in 1813. In the course of his raid he sacked and burnt the
town of Deori, and 15,000 persons perished in the flames. Colonel Jean Baptiste, Sindhia&#8217;s general, obtained a number of picked
Badhaks from R&#257;jput&#257;na and offered them a rich reward for the head of Z&#257;lim Singh; and after watching his camp for three months
they managed to come on him asleep in the tent of a dancing-girl, who was following his camp, and stabbed him to the heart.
For this deed they received Rs. 20,000 from Baptiste with other valuable presents. Their reputation was indeed such that they
were frequently employed at this period both by chiefs who desired to take the lives of others and by those who were anxious
for the preservation of their own. When it happened that a gang was caught after a robbery in a native State, the custom was
not infrequently to make them over to the merchant whose property they had taken, with permission to keep them in confinement
until they should refund his money; and in this manner by giving up the whole or a part of the proceeds of their robbery they
were enabled to regain their liberty. Even if they were sent before the courts, justice was at that time so corrupt as to
permit of easy avenues of escape for those who could afford to pay; and Colonel Sleeman records the deposition of a Badhak
describing their methods of bribery: &#8220;When police officers arrest Badhaks their old women get round them and give them large
sums of money; and they either release them or get their depositions so written that their release shall be ordered by the
magistrates. If they are brought to court, their old women, dressed in rags, follow them at a distance of three or four miles
with a thousand or two thousand rupees upon ponies; and these rupees they distribute among the native officers of the court
and get the Badhaks released. These old women first ascertain from the people of the villages <a id="d0e2258"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2258">57</a>]</span>who are the N&#257;zirs and Munshis of influence, and wait upon them at their houses and make their bargains. If the officials
cannot effect their release, they take money from the old women and send them off to the Sadar Court, with letters of introduction
to their friends, and advice as to the rate they shall pay to each according to his supposed influence. This is the way that
all our leaders get released, and hardly any but useless men are left in confinement.&#8221;<a id="d0e2260src" href="#d0e2260" class="noteref">12</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2263">
<h3>7. Pride in their profession.</h3>
<p>It may be noticed that these robbers took the utmost pleasure in their calling, and were most averse to the idea of giving
it up and taking to honest pursuits. &#8220;Some of the men with me,&#8221; one magistrate wrote,<a id="d0e2268src" href="#d0e2268" class="noteref">13</a> &#8220;have been in jail for twenty, and one man for thirty years, and still do not appear to have any idea of abandoning their
illegal vocation; even now, indeed, they look on what we consider an honest means of livelihood with the most marked contempt;
and in relating their excursions talk of them with the greatest pleasure, much in the way an eager sportsman describes a boar-chase
or fox-hunt. While talking of their excursions, which were to me really very interesting, their eyes gleamed with pleasure;
and beating their hands on their foreheads and breasts and muttering some ejaculation they bewailed the hardness of their
lot, which now ensured their never again being able to participate in such a joyous occupation.&#8221; Another Badhak, on being
examined, said he could not recall a case of one of the community having ever given up the trade of dacoity. &#8220;None ever did,
I am certain of it,&#8221; he continued.<a id="d0e2271src" href="#d0e2271" class="noteref">14</a> &#8220;After having been arrested, on our release we frequently take lands, to make it appear we have left off dacoity, but we
never do so in reality; it is only done as a feint and to enable our zam&#299;nd&#257;rs (landowners) to screen us.&#8221; They sometimes
paid rent for their land at the rate of thirty rupees an acre, in return for the countenance and protection afforded by the
zam&#299;nd&#257;rs. &#8220;Our profession,&#8221; another Badhak remarked,<a id="d0e2274src" href="#d0e2274" class="noteref">15</a> &#8220;has been a <i>P&#257;dsh&#257;hi K&#257;m</i> (a king&#8217;s trade); we have attacked and seized boldly the thousands and hundreds of thousands that we have freely <a id="d0e2280"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2280">58</a>]</span>and nobly spent; we have been all our lives wallowing in wealth and basking in freedom, and find it hard to manage with the
few copper pice a day we get from you.&#8221; At the time when captures were numerous, and the idea was entertained of inducing
the dacoits to settle in villages and supporting them until they had been trained to labour, several of them, on being asked
how much they would require to support themselves, replied that they could not manage on less than two rupees a day, having
earned quite that sum by dacoity. This amount would be more than twenty times the wages of an ordinary labourer at the same
period. Another witness put the amount at one to two rupees a day, remarking, &#8216;We are great persons for eating and drinking,
and we keep several wives according to our means.&#8217; Of some of them Colonel Sleeman had a high opinion, and he mentions the
case of one man, Aj&#299;t Singh, who was drafted into the native army and rose to be commander of a company. &#8220;I have seldom seen
a man,&#8221; he wrote,<a id="d0e2282src" href="#d0e2282" class="noteref">16</a> &#8220;whom I would rather have with me in scenes of peril and difficulty.&#8221; An attempt of the King of Oudh&#8217;s, however, to form
a regiment of Badhaks had ended in failure, as after a short time they mutinied, beat their commandant and other officers
and turned them out of the regiment, giving as their reason that the officers had refused to perform the same duties as the
men. And they visited with the same treatment all the other officers sent to them, until they were disbanded by the British
on the province of Allah&#257;b&#257;d being made over to the Company. Colonel Sleeman notes that they were never known to offer any
other violence or insult to females than to make them give up any gold ornaments that they might have about their persons.
&#8220;In all my inquiries into the character, habits and conduct of these gangs, I have never found an instance of a female having
been otherwise disgraced or insulted by them. They are all Hind&#363;s, and this reverence for the sex pervades all Hind&#363; society.&#8221;<a id="d0e2285src" href="#d0e2285" class="noteref">17</a> According to their own account also they never committed murder; if people opposed them they struck and killed like soldiers,
but this was considered to be in fair fight. It may be noted, nevertheless, that they had little idea of clan loyalty, and
<a id="d0e2288"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2288">59</a>]</span>informed very freely against their fellows when this course was to their advantage. They also stated that they could not settle
in towns; they had always been accustomed to live in the jungles and commit dacoities upon the people of the towns as a kind
of <i>shik&#257;r</i> (sport); they delighted in it, and they felt living in towns or among other men as a kind of prison, and got quite confused
(<i>ghabr&#257;ye</i>), and their women even more than the men.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2296">
<h3>8. Caste rules and admission of outsiders.</h3>
<p>The Badhaks had a regular caste organisation, and members of the different clans married with each other like the R&#257;jp&#363;ts
after whom they were named. They admitted freely into the community members of any respectable Hindu caste, but not the impure
castes or Muhammadans. But at least one instance of the admission of a Muhammadan is given.<a id="d0e2301src" href="#d0e2301" class="noteref">18</a> The Badhaks were often known to the people as Si&#257;rkhawa or jackal-eaters, or Sabkhawa, those who eat everything. And the
Muhammadan in question was given jackal&#8217;s flesh to eat, and having partaken of it was considered to have become a member of
the community. This indicates that the Badhaks were probably accustomed to eat the flesh of the jackal at a sacrificial meal,
and hence that they worshipped the jackal, revering it probably as the deity of the forests where they lived. Such a veneration
would account for the importance attached to the jackal&#8217;s cry as an omen. The fact of their eating jackals also points to
the conclusion that the Badhaks were not R&#257;jp&#363;ts, but a low hunting caste like the P&#257;rdhis and Bahelias. The P&#257;rdhis have
R&#257;jp&#363;t sept names as well as the Badhaks. No doubt a few outcaste R&#257;jp&#363;ts may have joined the gangs and become their leaders.
Others, however, said that they abstained from the flesh of jackals, snakes, foxes and cows and buffaloes. Children were frequently
adopted, being purchased in large numbers in time of famine, and also occasionally kidnapped. They were brought up to the
trade of dacoity, and if they showed sufficient aptitude for it were taken out on expeditions, but otherwise left at home
to manage the household affairs. They were married to other adopted children and were known as Ghul&#257;mi or Slave Badhaks, like
the J&#257;ngar <a id="d0e2304"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2304">60</a>]</span>Banj&#257;ras; and like them also, after some generations, when their real origin had been forgotten, they became full Badhaks.
It was very advantageous to a Badhak to have a number of children, because all plunder obtained was divided in regularly apportioned
shares among the whole community. Men who were too old to go on dacoity also received their share, and all children, even
babies born during the absence of the expedition. The Badhaks said that this rule was enforced because they thought it an
advantage to the community that families should be large and their numbers should increase; from which statement it must be
concluded that they seldom suffered any stringency from lack of spoil. They also stated that Badhak widows would go and find
a second husband from among the regular population, and as a rule would sooner or later persuade him to join the Badhaks.

<h3>9. Religion: offerings to ancestors.</h3>
<p>Like other Indian criminals the Badhaks were of a very religious or superstitious disposition. They considered the gods of
the Hindu creed as favouring their undertakings so long as they were suitably propitiated by offering to their temples and
priests, and the spirits of the most distinguished of their ancestors as exercising a vicarious authority under these deities
in guiding them to their prey and warning them of danger.<a id="d0e2311src" href="#d0e2311" class="noteref">19</a> The following is an account of a Badhak sacrifice given to Colonel Sleeman by the Aj&#299;t Singh already mentioned. It was in
celebration of a dacoity in which they had obtained Rs. 40,000, out of which Rs. 4500 were set aside for sacrifices to the
gods and charity to the poor. Aj&#299;t Singh said: &#8220;For offerings to the gods we purchase goats, sweet cakes and spirits; and
having prepared a feast we throw a handful of the savoury food upon the fire in the name of the gods who have most assisted
us; but of the feast so consecrated no female but a virgin can partake. The offering is made through the man who has successfully
invoked the god on that particular occasion; and, as my god had guided us this time, I was employed to prepare the feast for
him and to throw the offering upon the fire. The offering must be taken up before the feast is touched and put upon the <a id="d0e2314"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2314">61</a>]</span>fire, and a little water must be sprinkled on it. The savoury smell of the food as it burns reaches the nostrils of the god
and delights him. On this as on most occasions I invoked the spirit of Ganga Singh, my grandfather, and to him I made the
offering. I considered him to be the greatest of all my ancestors as a robber, and him I invoked on this solemn occasion.
He never failed me when I invoked him, and I had the greatest confidence in his aid. The spirits of our ancestors can easily
see whether we shall succeed in what we are about to undertake; and when we are to succeed they order us on, and when we are
not they make signs to us to desist.&#8221; Their mode<a id="d0e2316src" href="#d0e2316" class="noteref">20</a> of ascertaining which of their ancestors interested himself most in their affairs was commonly this, that whenever a person
talked incoherently in a fever or an epileptic fit, the spirit of one or other of his ancestors was supposed to be upon him.
If they were in doubt as to whose spirit it was, one of them threw down some grains of wheat or coloured glass beads, a pinch
at a time, saying the name of the ancestor he supposed the most likely to be at work and calling odd or even as he pleased.
If the number proved to be as he called it several times running while that name was repeated, they felt secure of their family
god, and proceeded at once to sacrifice a goat or something else in his name. When they were being hunted down and arrested
by Colonel Sleeman and his assistants, they ascribed their misfortunes to the anger of the goddess K&#257;li, because they had
infringed her rules and disregarded her signs, and said that their forefathers had often told them they would one day be punished
for their disobedience.<a id="d0e2319src" href="#d0e2319" class="noteref">21</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2322">
<h3>10. The wounded haunted by spirits.</h3>
<p>Whenever one of the gang was wounded and was taken with his wounds bleeding near a place haunted by a spirit, they believed
the spirit got angry and took hold of him,<a id="d0e2327src" href="#d0e2327" class="noteref">22</a> in the manner described by Aj&#299;t Singh as follows: &#8220;The spirit comes upon him in all kinds of shapes, sometimes in that of
a buffalo, at others in that of a woman, sometimes in the air above and sometimes from the ground below; but no one can see
him except the wounded person <a id="d0e2330"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2330">62</a>]</span>he is angry with and wants to punish. Upon such a wounded person we always place a naked sword or some other sharp steel instrument,
as spirits are much afraid of weapons of this kind. If there be any good conjurer at hand to charm away the spirits from the
person wounded he recovers, but nothing else can save him.&#8221; In one case a dacoit named Gh&#299;sa had been severely wounded in
an encounter and was seized by the spirit of a banyan tree as he was being taken away: &#8220;We made a litter with our ropes and
cloaks thrown over them and on this he was carried off by four of our party; at half a mile distant the road passed under
a large banyan tree and as the four men carried him along under the tree, the spirit of the place fell upon him and the four
men who carried him fell down with the shock. They could not raise him again, so much were they frightened, and four other
men were obliged to lift him and carry him off.&#8221; The man died of his wounds soon after they reached the halting-place, and
in commenting on this Aj&#299;t Singh continued: &#8220;When the spirit seized Gh&#299;sa under the tree we had unfortunately no conjurer,
and he, poor fellow, died in consequence. It was evident that a spirit had got hold of him, for he could not keep his head
upright; it always fell down upon his right or left shoulder as often as we tried to put it right; and he complained much
of a pain in the region of the liver. We therefore concluded that the spirit had broken his neck and was consuming his liver.&#8221;

<div class="div2" id="d0e2332">
<h3>11. Pious funeral observances.</h3>
<p>Like pious Hindus as they were, the Badhaks were accustomed, whenever it was possible, to preserve the bones of their dead
after the body had been burnt and carry them to the Ganges. If this was not possible, however, and the exigencies of their
profession obliged them to make away with the body without the performance of due funeral rites, they cut off two or three
fingers and sent these to the Ganges to be deposited instead of the whole body.<a id="d0e2337src" href="#d0e2337" class="noteref">23</a> In one case a dacoit, Kundana, was killed in an affray, and the others carried off his body and thrust it into a porcupine&#8217;s
hole after cutting off three of the fingers. &#8220;We gave Kundana&#8217;s fingers to his mother,&#8221; Aj&#299;t Singh stated, &#8220;and she sent them
<a id="d0e2340"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2340">63</a>]</span>with due offerings and ceremonies to the Ganges by the hands of the family priest. She gave this priest money to purchase
a cow, to be presented to the priests in the name of her deceased son, and to distribute in charity to the poor and to holy
men. She got from us for these purposes eighty rupees over and above her son&#8217;s share of the booty, while his widow and children
continued to receive their usual share of the takings of the gang so long as they remained with us.&#8221;

<div class="div2" id="d0e2342">
<h3>12. Taking the omens.</h3>
<p>Before setting out on an expedition it was their regular custom to take the omens, and the following account may be quoted
of the preliminaries to an expedition of the great leader, Meherb&#257;n Singh, who has already been mentioned: &#8220;In the latter
end of that year, Meherb&#257;n and his brother set out and assembled their friends on the bank of the Bisori river, where the
rate at which each member of the party should share in the spoil was determined in order to secure to the dependants of any
one who should fall in the enterprise their due share, as well as to prevent inconvenient disputes during and after the expedition.
The party assembled on this occasion, including women and children, amounted to two hundred, and when the shares had been
determined the goats were sacrificed for the feast. Each leader and member of the gang dipped his finger in the blood and
swore fidelity to his engagements and his associates under all circumstances. The whole feasted together and drank freely
till the next evening, when Meherb&#257;n advanced with about twenty of the principal persons to a spot chosen a little way from
the camp on the road they proposed to take in the expedition, and lifting up his hands in supplication said aloud, &#8216;If it
be thy will, O God, and thine, K&#257;li, to prosper our undertaking for the sake of the blind and the lame, <i>the widow and the orphan</i>, who depend upon our exertions for subsistence, vouchsafe, we pray thee, the call of the female jackal.&#8217; All his followers
held up their hands in the same manner and repeated these words after him. All then sat down and waited in silence for the
reply or spoke only in whispers. At last the cry of the female jackal was heard three times on the left, and believing her
to have been inspired by the deity for <a id="d0e2350"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2350">64</a>]</span>their guidance they were all much rejoiced.&#8221; The following was another more elaborate method of taking omens described by
Aj&#299;t Singh: &#8220;When we speak of seeking omens from our gods or Devi Deota, we mean the spirits of those of our ancestors who
performed great exploits in dacoity in their day, gained a great name and established lasting reputations. For instance, Mah&#257;j&#299;t,
my grandfather, and S&#257;hiba, his father, are called gods and admitted to be so by us all. We have all of us some such gods
to be proud of among our ancestors; we propitiate them and ask for favourable omens from them before we enter upon any enterprise.
We sometimes propitiate the S&#363;raj Deota (sun god) and seek good omens from him. We get two or three goats or rams, and sometimes
even ten or eleven, at the place where we determine to take the auspices, and having assembled the principal men of the gang
we put water into the mouth of one of them and pray to the sun and to our ancestors thus: &#8216;O thou Sun God! And O all ye other
Gods! If we are to succeed in the enterprise we are about to undertake we pray you to cause these goats to shake their bodies.&#8217;
If they do not shake them after the gods have been thus duly invoked, the enterprise must not be entered upon and the goats
are not sacrificed. We then try the auspices with wheat. We burn frankincense and scented wood and blow a shell; and taking
out a pinch of wheat grains, put them on the cloth and count them. If they come up odd the omen is favourable, and if even
it is bad. After this, which we call the auspices of the Ak&#363;t, we take that of the Si&#257;rni or female jackal. If it calls on
the left it is good, but if on the right bad. If the omens turn out favourable in all three trials then we have no fear whatever,
but if they are favourable in only one trial out of the three the enterprise must be given up.&#8221;

<h3>13. Suppression of dacoity.</h3>
<p>Between 1837 and 1849 the suppression of the regular practice of armed dacoity was practically achieved by Colonel Sleeman.
A number of officers were placed under his orders, and with small bodies of military and police were set to hunt down different
bands of dacoits, following them all over India when necessary. And special Acts were passed to <a id="d0e2357"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2357">65</a>]</span>enable the offence of dacoity, wherever committed, to be tried by a competent magistrate in any part of India as had been
done in the case of the Thugs. Many of the Badhaks received conditional pardons, and were drafted into the police in different
stations, and an agricultural labour colony was also formed, but does not seem to have been altogether successful. During
these twelve years more than 1200 dacoits in all were brought to trial, while some were killed during the operations, and
no doubt many others escaped and took to other avocations, or became ordinary criminals when their armed gangs were broken
up. In 1825 it had been estimated that the Oudh forests alone contained from 4000 to 6000 dacoits, while the property stolen
in 1811 from known dacoities was valued at ten lakhs of rupees.

<div class="div2" id="d0e2359">
<h3>14. The Badhaks or Baoris at the present time.</h3>
<p>The Badhaks still exist, and are well known as one of the worst classes of criminals, practising ordinary house-breaking and
theft. The name Badhak is now less commonly used than those of B&#257;gri and Baori or B&#257;waria, both of which were borne by the
original Badhaks. The word B&#257;gri is derived from a tract of country in M&#257;lwa which is known as the B&#257;gar or &#8216;hedge of thorns,&#8217;
because it is surrounded on all sides by wooded hills.<a id="d0e2364src" href="#d0e2364" class="noteref">24</a> There are B&#257;gri J&#257;ts and B&#257;gri R&#257;jp&#363;ts, many of whom are now highly respectable landholders. B&#257;waria or Baori is derived
from <i>b&#257;nwar</i>, a creeper, or the tendril of a vine, and hence a noose made originally from some fibrous plant and used for trapping animals,
this being one of the primary occupations of the tribe.<a id="d0e2373src" href="#d0e2373" class="noteref">25</a> The term Badhak signifies a hunter or fowler, hence a robber or murderer (Platts). The B&#257;gris and B&#257;warias are sometimes
considered to be separate communities, but it is doubtful whether there is any real distinction between them. In Bombay the
B&#257;gris are known as V&#257;ghris by the common change of <i>b</i> into <i>v</i>. A good description of them is contained in Appendix C to Mr. Bhimbhai Kirp&#257;r&#257;m&#8217;s volume <i>Hindus of Gujarat</i> in the <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i>. He divides them into the Chunaria or lime-burners, the D&#257;tonia or sellers of twig tooth-brushes, and two other groups, and
states that, &#8220;They also keep <a id="d0e2391"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2391">66</a>]</span>fowls and sell eggs, catch birds and go as <i>shik&#257;ris</i> or hunters. They traffic in green parrots, which they buy from Bh&#299;ls and sell for a profit.&#8221;

<div class="div2" id="d0e2396">
<h3>15. Lizard-hunting.</h3>
<p>Their strength and powers of endurance are great, the same writer states, and they consider that these qualities are obtained
by the eating of the <i>goh</i> and <i>s&#257;ndha</i> or iguana lizards, which a V&#257;ghri prizes very highly. This is also the case with the B&#257;warias of the Punjab, who go out hunting
lizards in the rains and may be seen returning with baskets full of live lizards, which exist for days without food and are
killed and eaten fresh by degrees. Their method of hunting the lizard is described by Mr. Wilson as follows:<a id="d0e2407src" href="#d0e2407" class="noteref">26</a> &#8220;The lizard lives on grass, cannot bite severely, and is sluggish in his movements, so that he is easily caught. He digs
a hole for himself of no great depth, and the easiest way to take him is to look out for the scarcely perceptible airhole
and dig him out; but there are various ways of saving oneself this trouble. One, which I have seen, takes advantage of a habit
the lizard has in cold weather (when he never comes out of his hole) of coming to the mouth for air and warmth. The Ch&#363;hra
or other sportsman puts off his shoes and steals along the prairie till he sees signs of a lizard&#8217;s hole. This he approaches
on tiptoe, raising over his head with both hands a mallet with a round sharp point, and fixing his eyes intently upon the
hole. When close enough he brings down his mallet with all his might on the ground just behind the mouth of the hole, and
is often successful in breaking the lizard&#8217;s back before he awakes to a sense of his danger. Another plan, which I have not
seen, is to tie a wisp of grass to a long stick and move it over the hole so as to make a rustling noise. The lizard within
thinks, &#8216;Oh here&#8217;s a snake! I may as well give in,&#8217; and comes to the mouth of the hole, putting out his tail first so that
he may not see his executioner. The sportsman seizes his tail and snatches him out before he has time to learn his mistake.&#8221;
This common fondness for lizards is a point in favour of a connection between the Gujar&#257;t V&#257;ghris and the Punjab B&#257;warias.


</p>

<div class="div2" id="d0e2411">
<h3>16. Social observances.</h3>
<p>In Sirsa the great mass of the B&#257;warias are not given to <a id="d0e2416"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2416">67</a>]</span>crime, and in Gujar&#257;t also they do not appear to have special criminal tendencies. It is a curious point, however, that Mr.
Bhimbhai Kirp&#257;r&#257;m emphasises the chastity of the women of the Gujar&#257;t V&#257;ghris.<a id="d0e2418src" href="#d0e2418" class="noteref">27</a> &#8220;When a family returns home after a money-making tour to Bombay or some other city, the women are taken before Vih&#257;t (Devi),
and with the women is brought a buffalo or a sheep that is tethered in front of Vih&#257;t&#8217;s shrine. They must confess all, even
their slightest shortcomings, such as the following: &#8216;Two weeks ago, when begging in P&#257;rsi Baz&#257;r-street, a drunken sailor
caught me by the hand. Another day a M&#299;yan or Musalm&#257;n ogled me, and forgive me, Devi, my looks encouraged him.&#8217; If Devi is
satisfied the sheep or buffalo shivers, and is then sacrificed and provides a feast for the caste.&#8221;<a id="d0e2421src" href="#d0e2421" class="noteref">28</a> On the other hand, Mr. Crooke states<a id="d0e2429src" href="#d0e2429" class="noteref">29</a> that in northern India, &#8220;The standard of morality is very low because in Muzaffarnagar it is extremely rare for a B&#257;waria
woman to live with her husband. Almost invariably she lives with another man: but the official husband is responsible for
the children.&#8221; The great difference in the standard of morality is certainly surprising.

</p>
<p>In Gujar&#257;t<a id="d0e2437src" href="#d0e2437" class="noteref">30</a> the V&#257;ghris have <i>gurus</i> or religious preceptors of their own. These men take an eight-anna silver piece and whisper in the ear of their disciples
&#8220;Be immortal.&#8221;... &#8220;The Bhuvas or priest-mediums play an important part in many V&#257;ghri ceremonies. A Bhuva is a male child
born after the mother has made a vow to the goddess Vih&#257;t or Devi that if a son be granted to her she will devote him to the
service of the goddess. No Bhuva may cut or shave his hair on pain of a fine of ten rupees, and no Bhuva may eat carrion or
food cooked by a Muhammadan.&#8221;

<h3>17. Criminal practices.</h3>
<p>The criminal B&#257;gris still usually travel about in the disguise of Gosains and Bair&#257;gis, and are very difficult of detection
except to real religious mendicants. Their housebreaking implement or jemmy is known as <i>Gy&#257;n</i>, but in speaking of it they always add <i>D&#257;s</i>, so that it sounds like <a id="d0e2459"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2459">68</a>]</span>the name of a Bair&#257;gi.<a id="d0e2461src" href="#d0e2461" class="noteref">31</a> They are usually very much afraid of the <i>gy&#257;n</i> being discovered on their persons, and are careful to bury it in the ground at each halting-place, while on the march it
may be concealed in a pack-saddle. The means of identifying them, Mr. Kennedy remarks,<a id="d0e2470src" href="#d0e2470" class="noteref">32</a> is by their family <i>deo</i> or god, which they carry about when wandering with their families. It consists of a brass or copper box containing grains
of wheat and the seeds of a creeper, both soaked in <i>gh&#299;</i> (melted butter). The box with a peacock&#8217;s feather and a bell is wrapped in two white and then in two red cloths, one of the
white cloths having the print of a man&#8217;s hand dipped in goat&#8217;s blood upon it. The grains of wheat are used for taking the
omens, a few being thrown up at sun-down and counted afterwards to see whether they are odd or even. When even, two grains
are placed on the right hand of the omen-taker, and if this occurs three times running the auspices are considered to be favourable.<a id="d0e2481src" href="#d0e2481" class="noteref">33</a> Mr. Gayer<a id="d0e2487src" href="#d0e2487" class="noteref">34</a> notes that the Badhaks have usually from one to three brands from a hot iron on the inside of their left wrist. Those of
them who are hunters brand the muscles of the left wrist in order to steady the hand when firing their matchlocks. The customs
of wearing a peculiar necklace of small wooden beads and a kind of gold pin fixed to the front teeth, which Mr. Crooke<a id="d0e2492src" href="#d0e2492" class="noteref">35</a> records as having been prevalent some years ago, have apparently been since abandoned, as they are not mentioned in more
recent accounts. The Dehliw&#257;l and M&#257;lpura Baorias have, Mr. Kennedy states,<a id="d0e2495src" href="#d0e2495" class="noteref">36</a> an interesting system of signs, which they mark on the walls of buildings at important corners, bridges and cross-roads and
on the ground by the roadside with a stick, if no building is handy. The commonest is a loop, the straight line indicating
the direction a gang or individual has taken:


</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure"><img border="0" src="images/p068.gif" alt="" width="157" height="57"></div><p>

<a id="d0e2503"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2503">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>The addition of a number of vertical strokes inside the loop signifies the number of males in a gang. If these strokes are
enclosed by a circle it means that the gang is encamped in the vicinity; while a square inside a circle and line as below
means that property has been secured by friends who have left in the direction pointed by the line. It is said that Baorias
will follow one another up for fifty or even a hundred miles by means of these hieroglyphics. The signs are bold marks, sometimes
even a foot or more in length, and are made where they will at once catch the eye. When the M&#257;rw&#257;ri Baorias desire to indicate
to others of their caste, who may follow in their footsteps, the route taken, a member of the gang, usually a woman, trails
a stick in the dust as she walks along, leaving a spiral track on the ground. Another method of indicating the route taken
is to place leaves under stones at intervals along the road.<a id="d0e2506src" href="#d0e2506" class="noteref">37</a> The form of crime most in favour among the ordinary Baoris is housebreaking by night. Their common practice is to make a
hole in the wall beside the door through which the hand passes to raise the latch; and only occasionally they dig a hole in
the base of the wall to admit of the passage of a man, while another favoured alternative is to break in through a barred
window, the bars being quickly and forcibly bent and drawn out.<a id="d0e2512src" href="#d0e2512" class="noteref">38</a> One class of M&#257;rw&#257;ri B&#257;gris are also expert coiners.

</span><h2>Bahna</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2524">
<h3>1. Nomenclature and internal structure.</h3>
<p><b>Bahna, Pinj&#257;ra, Dhunia.</b><a id="d0e2530src" href="#d0e2530" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;The occupational caste of cotton-cleaners. The Bahnas numbered 48,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r in 1911.
The large increase in the number of ginning-factories has ruined the Bahna&#8217;s trade of cleaning hand-ginned cotton, and as
no distinction attaches to the name of Bahna it is possible that members of the caste who have taken to other occupations
may have abandoned it and returned themselves <a id="d0e2533"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2533">70</a>]</span>simply as Muhammadans. The three names Bahna, Pinj&#257;ra, Dhunia appear to be used indifferently for the caste in this Province,
though in other parts of India they are distinguished. Pinj&#257;ra is derived from the word <i>pinjan</i> used for a cotton-bow, and Dhunia is from <i>dhunna</i>, to card cotton. The caste is also known as Dhunak Path&#257;ni. Though professing the Muhammadan religion, they still have many
Hindu customs and ceremonies, and in the matter of inheritance our courts have held that they are subject to Hindu and not
Muhammadan law.<a id="d0e2541src" href="#d0e2541" class="noteref">2</a> In Raipur a girl receives half the share of a boy in the division of inherited property. The caste appears to be a mixed
occupational group, and is split into many territorial subcastes named after the different parts of the country from which
its members have come, as Badharia from Badhas in M&#299;rz&#257;pur, Sars&#363;tia from the S&#257;raswati river, Ber&#257;ri of Ber&#257;r, Dakhni from
the Deccan, Telangi from Madras, Pardeshi from northern India, and so on. Two groups are occupational, the New&#257;ris of Saugor,
who make the thick <i>new&#257;r</i> tape used for the webbing of beds, and the Kanderas, who make fireworks and generally constitute a separate caste. There
is considerable ground for supposing that the Bahnas are mainly derived from the caste of Telis or oil-pressers. In the Punjab
Sir D. Ibbetson says<a id="d0e2550src" href="#d0e2550" class="noteref">3</a> that the Penja or cotton-scutcher is an occupational name applied to Telis who follow this profession; and that the Penja,
Kasai and Teli are all of the same caste. Similarly in N&#257;sik the Telis and Pinj&#257;ras are said to form one community, under
the government of a single <i>panch&#257;yat</i>. In cases of dispute or misconduct the usual penalty is temporary excommunication, which is known as the stopping of food
and water.<a id="d0e2558src" href="#d0e2558" class="noteref">4</a> The Telis are an enterprising community of very low status, and would therefore be naturally inclined to take to other occupations;
many of them are shopkeepers, cultivators and landholders, and it is quite probable that in past times they took up the Bahna&#8217;s
profession and changed their religion with the hope of improving their social status. <a id="d0e2563"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2563">71</a>]</span>The Telis are generally considered to be quarrelsome and talkative, and the Bahnas or Dhunias have the same characteristics.
If one man abusing another lapses into Billingsgate, the other will say to him, &#8216;<i lang="und">Hamko Jul&#257;ha Dhunia neh j&#257;no</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;Don&#8217;t talk to me as if I was a Jul&#257;ha or a Dhunia.&#8217;

<div class="div2" id="d0e2568">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Some Bahnas have exogamous sections with Hindu names, while others are without these, and simply regulate their marriages
by rules of relationship. They have the primitive Hindu custom of allowing a sister&#8217;s son to marry a brother&#8217;s daughter, but
not <i>vice versa</i>. A man cannot marry his wife&#8217;s younger sister during her lifetime, nor her elder sister at any time. Children of the same
foster-mother are also not allowed to marry. Their marriages are performed by a K&#257;zi with an imitation of the Nik&#257;h rite.
The bridegroom&#8217;s party sit under the marriage-shed, and the bride with the women of her party inside the house. The K&#257;zi selects
two men, one from the bride&#8217;s party, who is known as the Nik&#257;hi B&#257;p or &#8216;Marriage Father,&#8217; and the other from the bridegroom&#8217;s,
who is called the Gow&#257;h or &#8216;Witness.&#8217; These two men go to the bride and ask her whether she accepts the bridegroom, whose
name is stated, for her husband. She answers in the affirmative, and mentions the amount of the dowry which she is to receive.
The bridegroom, who has hitherto had a veil (<i>mukhna</i>) over his face, now takes it off, and the men go to him and ask him whether he accepts the bride. He replies that he does,
and agrees to pay the dowry demanded by her. The K&#257;zi reads some texts and the guests are given a meal of rice and sugar.
Many of the preliminaries to a Hindu marriage are performed by the more backward members of the caste, and until recently
they erected a sacred post in the marriage-shed, but now they merely hang the green branch of a mango tree to the roof. The
minimum amount of the <i>mehar</i> or dowry is said to be Rs. 125, but it is paid to the girl&#8217;s parents as a bride-price and not to herself, as among the Muhammadans.
A widow is expected, but not obliged, to marry her deceased husband&#8217;s younger brother. Divorce is permitted by means of a
written deed known as &#8216;F&#257;rkhati.&#8217;

<h3>3. Religious and other customs.</h3>
<p>The Bahnas venerate Muhammad, and also worship the tombs of Muhammadan saints or <i>P&#299;rs</i>. A green sheet or cloth is spread over the tomb and a lamp is kept burning by it, while offerings of incense and flowers
are made. When the new cotton crop has been gathered they lay some new cotton by their bow and mallet and make an offering
of <i>mal&#299;da</i> or cakes of flour and sugar to it. They believe that two angels, one good and one bad, are perched continually on the shoulders
of every man to record his good and evil deeds. And when an eclipse occurs they say that the sun and moon have gone behind
a pinnacle or tower of the heavens. For exorcising evil spirits they write texts of the Kor&#257;n on paper and burn them before
the sufferer. The caste bury the dead with the feet pointing to the south. On the way to the grave each one of the mourners
places his shoulder under the bier for a time, partaking of the impurity communicated by it. Incense is burnt daily in the
name of a deceased person for forty days after his death, with the object probably of preventing his ghost from returning
to haunt the house. Muhammadan beggars are fed on the tenth day. Similarly, after the birth of a child a woman is unclean
for forty days, and cannot cook for her husband during that period. A child&#8217;s hair is cut for the first time on the tenth
or twelfth day after birth, this being known as Jh&#257;lar. Some parents leave a lock of hair to grow on the head in the name
of the famous saint Sheikh Far&#299;d, thinking that they will thus ensure a long life for the child. It is probably in reality
a way of preserving the Hindu <i>choti</i> or scalp-lock.

<h3>4. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The hereditary calling<a id="d0e2606src" href="#d0e2606" class="noteref">5</a> of the Bahna is the cleaning or scutching of cotton, which is done by subjecting it to the vibration of a bow-string. The
seed has been previously separated by a hand-gin, but the ginned cotton still contains much dirt, leaf-fibre and other rubbish,
and to remove this is the Bahna&#8217;s task. The bow is somewhat in the shape of a harp, the wide end consisting of a broad piece
of wood over which the string passes, being secured to a straight wooden bar at the back. At the narrow end the bar and string
are fixed to an iron ring. The string is made of the <a id="d0e2612"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2612">73</a>]</span>sinew of some animal, and this renders the implement objectionable to Hindus, and may account for the Bahnas being Muhammadans.
The club or mallet is a wooden implement shaped like a dumb-bell. The bow is suspended from the roof so as to hang just over
the pile of loose cotton; and the worker twangs the string with the mallet and then draws the mallet across the string, each
three or four times. The string strikes a small portion of the cotton, the fibre of which is scattered by the impact and thrown
off in a uniform condition of soft fluff, all dirt being at the same time removed. This is the operation technically known
as teasing. Buchanan remarked that women frequently did the work themselves at home, using a smaller kind of bow called <i>dhunkara</i>. The clean cotton is made up into balls, some of which are passed on to the spinner, while others are used for the filling
of quilts and the padded coats worn in the cold weather. The ingenious though rather clumsy method of the Bahna has been superseded
by the ginning-factory, and little or no cotton destined for the spindle is now cleaned by him. The caste have been forced
to take to cultivation or field labour, while many have become cartmen and others are brokers, peons or constables. Nearly
every house still has its <i>pinjan</i> or bow, but only a desultory use is made of this during the winter months. As it is principally used by a Muhammadan caste
it seems a possible hypothesis that the cotton-bow was introduced into India by invaders of that religion. The name of the
bow, <i>pinjan</i>, is, however, a Sanskrit derivative, and this is against the above theory. It has already been seen that the fact of animal
sinew being used for the string would make it objectionable to Hindus. The Bahnas are subjected to considerable ridicule on
account of their curious mixture of Hindu and Muhammadan ceremonies, amounting in some respects practically to a caricature
of the rites of Isl&#257;m; and further, they share with the weaver class the contempt shown to those who follow a calling considered
more suitable for women than men. It is related that when the Mughal general Asaf Kh&#257;n first made an expedition into the north
of the Central Provinces he found the famous Gond-R&#257;jp&#363;t queen Durg&#257;vati of the Garha-Mandla dynasty governing with success
a large and <a id="d0e2623"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2623">74</a>]</span>prosperous state in this locality. He thought a country ruled by a woman should fall an easy prey to the Muhammadan arms,
and to show his contempt for her power he sent her a golden spindle. The queen retorted by a present of a gold cotton-cleaner&#8217;s
bow, and this so enraged the Mughal that he proceeded to attack the Gond kingdom. The story indicates that cotton-carding
is considered a Muhammadan profession, and also that it is held in contempt.

<h3>5. Proverbs about Bahnas.</h3>
<p>Various sayings show that the Bahna is not considered a proper Muhammadan, as

<p class="line" style=""><span>Turuk to Turuk

<p>or &#8216;A Muhammadan (Turk) is a Muhammadan and the Bahna is also a Muhammadan&#8217;; and again&#8212;

</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Muhammad se d&#363;r, D&#299;n se niy&#257;ra,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or &#8216;The Kachera and Pinj&#257;ra are lost to Muhammad and far from the faith&#8217;; and again&#8212;


</p>
<div class="poem" lang="und">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>Adho Hindu adho Musalm&#257;n
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Tinkhon kahen Dhunak Path&#257;n,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or &#8216;Half a Hindu and half a Muhammadan, that is he who is a Dhunak Path&#257;n.&#8217; They have a grotesque imitation of the Muhammadan
rite of <i>hal&#257;l</i>, or causing an animal&#8217;s blood to flow on to the ground with the repetition of the <i>kalma</i> or invocation; thus it is said that when a Bahna is about to kill a fowl he addresses it somewhat as follows:


</p>
<div class="poem" lang="und">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>K&#257;he karkar&#257;t hai?
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>K&#257;he barbar&#257;t hai?
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>K&#257;he jai jai logon ka d&#257;na kh&#257;t h&#257;i?
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Tor ki&#257;mat mor ni&#257;mat,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Bismill&#257;h hai tuch,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or &#8220;Why do you cackle? Why do you crow? Why do you eat other people&#8217;s grain? Your death is my feast; I touch you in the name
of God.&#8221; And saying this he puts a knife to the fowl&#8217;s throat. The vernacular verse is a good <a id="d0e2673"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2673">75</a>]</span>imitation of the cackling of a fowl. And again, they slice off the top of an egg as if they were killing an animal and repeat
the formula, &#8220;White dome, full of moisture, I know not if there is a male or female within; in the name of God I kill you.&#8221;
A person whose memory is not good enough to retain these texts will take a knife and proceed to one who knows them. Such a
man will repeat the texts over the knife, blowing on it as he does so, and the Bahna considers that the knife has been sanctified
and retains its virtue for a week. Others do not think this necessary, but have a special knife, which having once been consecrated
is always kept for killing animals, and descends as an heirloom in the family, the use of this sacred knife being considered
to make the repetition of the <i>kalma</i> unnecessary. These customs are, however, practised only by the ignorant members of the caste in Raipur and Bil&#257;spur, and
are unknown in the more civilised tracts, where the Bahnas are rapidly conforming to ordinary Muhammadan usage. Such primitive
Bahnas perform their marriages by walking round the sacred post, keep the Hindu festivals, and feed Br&#257;hmans on the tenth
day after a death. They have a priest whom they call their K&#257;zi, but elect him themselves. In some places when a Bahna goes
to the well to draw water he first washes the parapet of the well to make it ceremonially clean, and then draws his water.
This custom can only be compared with that of the R&#257;j-Gonds who wash the firewood with which they are about to cook their
food, in order to make it more pure. Respectable Muhammadans naturally look down on the Bahnas, and they retaliate by refusing
to take food or water from any Muhammadan who is not a Bahna. By such strictness the more ignorant think that they will enhance
their ceremonial purity and hence their social consideration; but the intelligent members of the caste know better and are
glad to improve themselves by learning from educated Muhammadans. The other menial artisan castes among the Muhammadans have
similar ideas, and it is reported that a Rangrez boy who took food in the house of one of the highest Muhammadan officers
of Government in the Province was temporarily put out of caste. Another saying about the Bahnas is&#8212;

<a id="d0e2678"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2678">76</a>]</span></p>
<div class="poem" lang="und">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>Sheikhon k&#299; Sheikhi,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style="text-indent: 2em; "><span>Path&#257;non k&#299; tarr,</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Turkon k&#299; Turksh&#257;hi,

<p class="line" style="text-indent: 2em; "><span>Bahnon k&#299; bharrr ...</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or &#8216;Proud as a Sheikh, obstinate as a Path&#257;n, royal as a Turk, buzzing like a Bahna.&#8217; This refers to the noise of the cotton-cleaning
bow, the twang of which as it is struck by the club is like a quail flying; and at the same time to the Bahna&#8217;s loquacity.
Another story is that a Bahna was once going through the forest with his cotton-cleaning bow and club or mallet, when a jackal
met him on the path. The jackal was afraid that the Bahna would knock him on the head, so he said, &#8220;With thy bow on thy shoulder
and thine arrow in thy hand, whither goest thou, O King of Delhi?&#8221; The Bahna was exceedingly pleased at this and replied,
&#8216;King of the forest, eater of wild plums, only the great can recognise the great.&#8217; But when the jackal had got to a safe distance
he turned round and shouted, &#8220;With your cotton-bow on your shoulder and your club in your hand, there you go, you sorry Bahna.&#8221;
It is said also that although the Bahnas as good Muhammadans wear beards, they do not cultivate them very successfully, and
many of them only have a growth of hair below the chin and none on the under-lip, in the fashion known as a goat&#8217;s beard.
This kind of beard is thus proverbially described as &#8216;<i lang="und">Bahna kaisi d&#257;rhi</i>&#8217; or &#8216;A Bahna&#8217;s beard.&#8217; It may be repeated in conclusion that much of the ridicule attaching to the Bahnas arises simply from
the fact that they follow what is considered a feminine occupation, and the remainder because in their ignorance they parody
the rites of Isl&#257;m. It may seem ill-natured to record the sayings in which they are lampooned, but the Bahnas cannot read
English, and these have an interest as specimens of popular wit.

<h3>1. The tribe and its offshoots.</h3>
<p><b>Baiga.</b><a id="d0e2756src" href="#d0e2756" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A primitive Dravidian tribe whose home is on the eastern Satp&#363;ra hills in the Mandla, B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t and Bil&#257;spur Districts. The
number of the Baigas proper was only 30,000 in 1911. But the Binjh&#257;ls or Binjhw&#257;rs, a fairly numerous caste in the Chhatt&#299;sgarh
Division, and especially in the Sambalpur District, appear to have been originally Baigas, though they have dropped the original
caste name, become Hinduised, and now disclaim connection with the parent tribe. A reason for this may be found in the fact
that Sambalpur contains several Binjhw&#257;r zam&#299;nd&#257;rs, or large landowners, whose families would naturally desire a more respectable
pedigree than one giving them the wild Baigas of the Satp&#363;ras for their forefathers. And the evolution of the Binjhw&#257;r caste
is a similar phenomenon to the constitution of the R&#257;j-Gonds, the R&#257;j-Korkus, and other aristocratic subdivisions among the
forest tribes, who have been admitted to a respectable position in the Hindu social community. The Binjhw&#257;rs, however, have
been so successful as to cut themselves off almost completely from connection with the original tribe, owing to their adoption
of another name. But in B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t and Mandla the Binjhw&#257;r <a id="d0e2765"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2765">78</a>]</span>subtribe is still recognised as the most civilised subdivision of the Baigas. The Bhainas, a small tribe in Bil&#257;spur, are
probably another offshoot, Kath-Bhaina being the name of a subtribe of Baigas in that District, and Rai-Bhaina in B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t,
though the Bhainas too no longer admit identity with the Baigas. A feature common to all three branches is that they have
forgotten their original tongue, and now speak a more or less corrupt form of the Indo-Aryan vernaculars current around them.
Finally, the term Bhumia or &#8216;Lord of the soil&#8217; is used sometimes as the name of a separate tribe and sometimes as a synonym
for Baiga. The fact is that in the Central Provinces<a id="d0e2767src" href="#d0e2767" class="noteref">2</a> Bhumia is the name of an office, that of the priest of the village and local deities, which is held by one of the forest
tribes. In the tract where the Baigas live, they, as the most ancient residents, are usually the priests of the indigenous
gods; but in Jubbulpore the same office is held by another tribe, the Bharias. The name of the office often attaches itself
to members of the tribe, who consider it as somewhat more respectable than their own, and it is therefore generally true to
say that the people known as Bhumias in Jubbulpore are really Bharias, but in Mandla and Bil&#257;spur they are Baigas.

</p>
<p>In Mandla there is also found a group called Bharia-Baigas. These are employed as village priests by Hindus, and worship certain
Hindu deities and not the Gond gods. They may perhaps be members of the Bharia tribe of Jubbulpore, originally derived from
the Bhars, who have obtained the designation of Baiga, owing to their employment as village priests. But they now consider
themselves a part of the Baiga tribe and say they came to Mandla from Rewah. In Mandla the decision of a Baiga on a boundary
dispute is almost always considered as final, and this authority is of a kind that commonly emanates from recognised priority
of residence.<a id="d0e2772src" href="#d0e2772" class="noteref">3</a> There seems reason to suppose that the Baigas are really a branch of the primitive Bhuiya tribe of Chota N&#257;gpur, and that
they have taken or been given the name of Baiga, the designation of a village priest, on migration into the Central Provinces.
There is reason to <a id="d0e2778"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2778">79</a>]</span>believe that the Baigas were once dominant in the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain and the hills surrounding it which adjoin Chota N&#257;gpur,
the home of the Bhuiyas. The considerations in favour of this view are given in the article on Bhuiya, to which reference
may be made.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2780">
<h3>2. Tribal legends.</h3>
<p>The Baigas, however, are not without some conceit of themselves, as the following legend will show. In the beginning, they
say, God created Nanga Baiga and Nangi Baigin, the first of the human race, and asked them by what calling they would choose
to live. They at once said that they would make their living by felling trees in the jungle, and permission being accorded,
have done so ever since. They had two sons, one of whom remained a Baiga, while the other became a Gond and a tiller of the
soil. The sons married their own two sisters who were afterwards born, and while the elder couple are the ancestors of the
Baigas, from the younger are descended the Gonds and all the remainder of the human race. In another version of the story
the first Baiga cut down two thousand old <i>s&#257;l</i><a id="d0e2787src" href="#d0e2787" class="noteref">4</a> trees in one day, and God told him to sprinkle a few grains of kutki on the ashes, and then to retire and sleep for some
months, when on his return he would be able to reap a rich harvest for his children. In this manner the habit of shifting
cultivation is accorded divine sanction. According to Binjhw&#257;r tradition Nanga Baiga and Nangi Baigin dwelt on the <i>kajli ban pah&#257;r</i>, which being interpreted is the hill of elephants, and may well refer to the ranges of Mandla and Bil&#257;spur. It is stated
in the <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i><a id="d0e2796src" href="#d0e2796" class="noteref">5</a> that the country of Garha-Mandla abounded in wild elephants, and that the people paid their tribute in these and gold mohurs.
In Mandla the Baigas sometimes hang out from their houses a bamboo mat fastened to a long pole to represent a flag which they
say once flew from the palace of a Baiga king. It seems likely that the original home of the tribe may have been the Chhatt&#299;sgarh
plain and the hill-ranges surrounding it. A number of estates in these hills are held by landowners of tribes which are offshoots
of the Baigas, as the Bhainas and Binjhw&#257;rs. The point is <a id="d0e2802"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2802">80</a>]</span>further discussed in the article on Bhuiya. Most of the Baigas speak a corrupt form of the Chhatt&#299;sgarhi dialect. When they
first came under the detailed observation of English officers in the middle of the nineteenth century, the tribe were even
more solitary and retired than at present. Their villages, it is said, were only to be found in places far removed from all
cleared and cultivated country. No roads or well-defined paths connected them with ordinary lines of traffic and more thickly
inhabited tracts, but perched away in snug corners in the hills, and hidden by convenient projecting spurs and dense forests
from the country round, they could not be seen except when nearly approached, and were seldom visited unless by occasional
enterprising Banias and vendors of country liquor. Indeed, without a Baiga for a guide many of the villages could hardly be
discovered, for nothing but occasional notches on the trees distinguished the tracks to them from those of the s&#257;mbhar and
other wild animals.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2804">
<h3>3. Tribal subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The following seven subdivisions or subtribes are recognised: Binjhw&#257;r, Bharotia, Narotia or N&#257;har, Raibhaina, Kathbhaina,
Kondw&#257;n or Kundi, and Gondwaina. Of these the Binjhw&#257;r, Bharotia and Narotia are the best-known. The name of the Binjhw&#257;rs
is probably derived from the Vindhyan range, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit <i>vindhya</i>, a hunter. The rule of exogamy is by no means strictly observed, and in Kawardha it is said that these three subcastes intermarry
though they do not eat together, while in B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t the Bharotias and Narotias both eat together and intermarry. In both places
the Binjhw&#257;rs occupy the highest position, and the other two subtribes will take food from them. The Binjhw&#257;rs consider themselves
as Hindus and abjure the consumption of buffalo&#8217;s and cow&#8217;s flesh and rats, while the other Baigas will eat almost anything.
The Bharotias partially shave their heads, and in Mandla are apparently known as Mundia or Mudia, or &#8220;shaven.&#8221; The Gondwainas
eat both cow&#8217;s flesh and monkeys, and are regarded as the lowest subcaste. As shown by their name they are probably the offspring
of unions between Baigas and Gonds. Similarly the Kondw&#257;ns apparently derive their name from the tract south of the <a id="d0e2812"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2812">81</a>]</span>Mah&#257;nadi which is named after the Khond tribe, and was formerly owned by them.

</p>
<p>Each subtribe is divided into a number of exogamous septs, the names of which are identical in many cases with those of the
Gonds, as Mark&#257;m, Mar&#257;vi, Net&#257;m, Tek&#257;m and others. Gond names are found most frequently among the Gondwainas and Narotias,
and these have adopted from the Gonds the prohibition of marriage between worshippers of the same number of gods. Thus the
four septs above mentioned worship seven gods and may not intermarry. But they may marry among other septs such as the Dhurua,
Pus&#257;m, Bania and Maw&#257;r who worship six gods. The Baigas do not appear to have assimilated the further division into worshippers
of five, four, three and two gods which exist among the Gonds in some localities, and the system is confined to the lower
subtribes. The meanings of the sept names have been forgotten and no instances of totemism are known. And the Binjhw&#257;rs and
Bharotias, who are more or less Hinduised, have now adopted territorial names for their septs, as Lapheya from L&#257;pha zam&#299;nd&#257;ri,
Ghugharia from Ghughri village in Mandla, and so on. The adoption of Gond names and septs appears to indicate that Gonds were
in former times freely admitted into the Baiga tribe; and this continues to be the case at present among the lower subtribes,
so far that a Gond girl marrying a Baiga becomes a regular member of the community. But the Binjhw&#257;rs and Bharotias, who have
a somewhat higher status than the others, refuse to admit Gonds, and are gradually adopting the strict rule of endogamy within
the subtribe.

<div class="div2" id="d0e2816">
<h3>4. Marriage.</h3>
<p>A Baiga must not take a wife from his own sept or from another one worshipping the same number of gods. But he may marry within
his mother&#8217;s sept, and in some localities the union of first cousins is permitted. Marriage is adult and the proposal comes
from the parents of the bride, but in some places the girl is allowed to select a husband for herself. A price varying from
five to twenty rupees is usually paid to the bride&#8217;s parents, or in lieu of this the prospective husband serves his father-in-law
for a period of about two years, the marriage being celebrated after the first year if his conduct is satisfactory. Orphan
boys who have no parents to arrange <a id="d0e2821"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2821">82</a>]</span>their marriages for them often take service for a wife. Three ceremonies should precede the marriage. The first, which may
take place at any time after the birth of both children, consists merely in the arrangement for their betrothal. The second
is only a ratification of the first, feasts being provided by the boy&#8217;s parents on both occasions. While on the approach of
the children to marriageable age the final betrothal or <i>barokhi</i> is held. The boy&#8217;s father gives a large feast at the house of the girl and the date of the wedding is fixed. To ascertain
whether the union will be auspicious, two grains of rice are dropped into a pot of water, after various preliminary solemnities
to mark the importance of the occasion. If the points of the grains meet almost immediately it is considered that the marriage
will be highly auspicious. If they do not meet, a second pair of grains are dropped in, and should these meet it is believed
that the couple will quarrel after an interval of married life and that the wife will return to her father&#8217;s house. While
if neither of the two first essays are successful and a third pair is required, the regrettable conclusion is arrived at that
the wife will run away with another man after a very short stay with her husband. But it is not stated that the betrothal
is on that account annulled. The wedding procession starts from the bridegroom&#8217;s house<a id="d0e2826src" href="#d0e2826" class="noteref">6</a> and is received by the bride&#8217;s father outside the village. It is considered essential that he should go out to meet the bride&#8217;s
party riding on an elephant. But as a real elephant is not within the means of a Baiga, two wooden bedsteads are lashed together
and covered with blankets with a black cloth trunk in front, and this arrangement passes muster for an elephant. The elephant
makes pretence to charge and trample down the marriage procession, until a rupee is paid, when the two parties embrace each
other and proceed to the marriage-shed. Here the bride and bridegroom throw fried rice at each other until they are tired,
and then walk three or seven times round the marriage-post with their clothes tied together. It is stated by Colonel Ward
that the couple always retired to the forest to spend <a id="d0e2829"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2829">83</a>]</span>the wedding night, but this custom has now been abandoned. The expenditure on a marriage varies between ten and fifty rupees,
of which only about five rupees fall on the bride&#8217;s parents. The remarriage of widows is permitted, and the widow is expected,
though not obliged, to wed her late husband&#8217;s younger brother, while if she takes another husband he must pay her brother-in-law
the sum of five rupees. The ceremony consists merely of the presentation of bangles and new clothes by the suitor, in token
of her acceptance of which the widow pours some tepid water stained with turmeric over his head. Divorce may be effected by
the husband and wife breaking a straw in the presence of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee. If the woman remains in the same village and does not marry again, the husband is responsible for her maintenance
and that of her children, while a divorced woman may not remarry without the sanction of the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> so long as her husband is alive and remains single. Polygamy is permitted.

<div class="div2" id="d0e2837">
<h3>5. Birth and funeral rites.</h3>
<p>A woman is unclean for a month after childbirth, though the Binjhw&#257;rs restrict the period to eight days. At the ceremony of
purification a feast is given and the child is named, often after the month or day of its birth, as Chaitu, Ph&#257;gu, Saoni,
and so on, from the months of Chait, Ph&#257;gun and Shr&#257;wan. Children who appear to be physically defective are given names accordingly,
such as Langra (lame), or Bahira (deaf). The dead are usually buried, the bodies of old persons being burnt as a special honour
and to save them from the risk of being devoured by wild animals. Bodies are laid naked in the grave with the head pointing
to the south. In the grave of a man of importance two or three rupees and some tobacco are placed. In some places a rupee
is thrust into the mouth of the dying man, and if his body is burnt, the coin is recovered from the pyre by his daughter or
sister, who wears it as an amulet. Over the grave a platform is made on which a stone is erected. This is called the Bh&#299;ri
of the deceased and is worshipped by his relatives in time of trouble. If one of the family has to be buried elsewhere, the
relatives go to the Bh&#299;ri of the great dead and consign his spirit to be kept in their company. At a funeral the mourners
take one black <a id="d0e2842"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2842">84</a>]</span>and one white fowl to a stream and kill and eat them there, setting aside a portion for the dead man. Mourning is observed
for a period of from two to nine days, and during this time labour and even household work are stopped, food being supplied
by the friends of the family. When a man is killed by a tiger the Baiga priest goes to the spot and there makes a small cone
out of the blood-stained earth. This must represent a man, either the dead man or one of his living relatives. His companions
having retired a few paces, the priest goes on his hands and knees and performs a series of antics which are supposed to represent
the tiger in the act of destroying the man, at the same time seizing the lump of blood-stained earth in his teeth. One of
the party then runs up and taps him on the back with a small stick. This perhaps means that the tiger is killed or otherwise
rendered harmless; and the Baiga immediately lets the mud cone fall into the hands of one of the party. It is then placed
in an ant-hill and a pig is sacrificed over it. The next day a small chicken is taken to the place, and after a mark supposed
to be the dead man&#8217;s name is made on its head with red ochre, it is thrown back into the forest, the priest exclaiming, &#8216;Take
this and go home.&#8217; The ceremony is supposed to lay the dead man&#8217;s spirit and at the same time to prevent the tiger from doing
any further damage. The Baigas believe that the ghost of the victim, if not charmed to rest, resides on the head of the tiger
and incites him to further deeds of blood, rendering him also secure from harm by his preternatural watchfulness.<a id="d0e2844src" href="#d0e2844" class="noteref">7</a>

</p>
<p>They also think that they can shut up the tiger&#8217;s <i>d&#257;r</i> or jaws, so that he cannot bite them, by driving a nail into a tree. The forest track from K&#257;nha to Kisli in the Banjar forest
reserve of Mandla was formerly a haunt of man-eating tigers, to whom a number of the wood-cutters and Baiga coolies, clearing
the jungle paths, fell victims every year. In a large tree, at a dangerous point in the track, there could recently be seen
a nail, driven into the trunk by a Baiga priest, at some height from the ground. It was said that this nail shut the mouth
of a famous man-eating tiger of the locality and prevented him from killing any <a id="d0e2855"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2855">85</a>]</span>more victims. As evidence of the truth of the story there were shown on the trunk the marks of the tiger&#8217;s claws, where he
had been jumping up the tree in the effort to pull the nail out of the trunk and get his man-eating powers restored.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2857">
<h3>6. Religion.</h3>
<p>Although the Binjhw&#257;r subcaste now profess Hinduism, the religion of the Baigas is purely animistic. Their principal deity
is Bura Deo,<a id="d0e2862src" href="#d0e2862" class="noteref">8</a> who is supposed to reside in a <i>s&#257;j</i> tree (<i>Terminalia tomentosa</i>); he is worshipped in the month of Jeth (May), when goats, fowls, cocoanuts, and the liquor of the new mahua crop are offered
to him. Th&#257;kur Deo is the god of the village land and boundaries, and is propitiated with a white goat. The Baigas who plough
the fields have a ceremony called Bidri, which is performed before the breaking of the rains. A handful of each kind of grain
sown is given by each cultivator to the priest, who mixes the grains together and sows a little beneath the tree where Th&#257;kur
Deo lives. After this he returns a little to each cultivator, and he sows it in the centre of the land on which crops are
to be grown, while the priest keeps the remainder. This ceremony is believed to secure the success of the harvest. Dulha Deo
is the god who averts disease and accident, and the offering made to him should consist of a fowl or goat of reddish colour.
Bh&#299;msen is the deity of rainfall, and Dharti M&#257;ta or Mother Earth is considered to be the wife of Th&#257;kur Deo, and must also
be propitiated for the success of the crops. The grain itself is worshipped at the threshing floor by sprinkling water and
liquor on to it. Certain Hindu deities are also worshipped by the Baigas, but not in orthodox fashion. Thus it would be sacrilege
on the part of a Hindu to offer animal sacrifices to N&#257;r&#257;yan Deo, the sun-god, but the Baigas devote to him a special oblation
of the most unclean animal, the pig. The animal to be sacrificed is allowed to wander loose for two or three years, and is
then killed in a most cruel manner. It is laid across the threshold of a doorway on its back, and across its stomach is placed
a stout plank of <i>s&#257;j</i>-wood. Half a dozen men sit or stand on the ends of this, and the fore and hind feet of the pig are pulled backwards and forwards
alternately over <a id="d0e2877"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2877">86</a>]</span>the plank until it is crushed to death, while all the men sing or shout a sacrificial hymn. The head and feet are cut off
and offered to the deity, and the body is eaten. The forests are believed to be haunted by spirits, and in certain localities
<i>p&#257;ts</i> or shrines are erected in their honour, and occasional offerings are made to them. The spirits of married persons are supposed
to live in streams, while trees afford a shelter to the souls of the unmarried, who become <i>bh&#363;ts</i> or malignant spirits after death. N&#257;g Deo or the cobra is supposed to live in an ant-hill, and offerings are made to him
there. Demoniacal possession is an article of faith, and a popular remedy is to burn human hair mixed with chillies and pig&#8217;s
dung near the person possessed, as the horrible smell thus produced will drive away the spirit. Many and weird, Mr. Low writes,
are the simples which the Baiga&#8217;s travelling scrip contains. Among these a dried bat has the chief place; this the Baiga says
he uses to charm his nets with, that the prey may catch in them as the bat&#8217;s claws catch in whatever it touches. As an instance
of the Baiga&#8217;s pantheism it may be mentioned that on one occasion when a train of the new Satp&#363;ra railway<a id="d0e2885src" href="#d0e2885" class="noteref">9</a> had pulled up at a wayside forest station, a Baiga was found offering a sacrifice to the engine. Like other superstitious
people they are great believers in omens. A single crow bathing in a stream is a sign of death. A cock which crows in the
night should be instantly killed and thrown into the darkness, a custom which some would be glad to see introduced into much
more civilised centres. The woodpecker and owl are birds of bad omen. The Baigas do not appear to have any idea of a fresh
birth, and one of their marriage songs says, &#8220;O girl, take your pleasure in going round the marriage-post once and for all,
for there is no second birth.&#8221; The Baigas are generally the priests of the Gonds, probably because being earlier residents
of the country they are considered to have a more intimate acquaintance with the local deities. They have a wide knowledge
of the medicinal properties of jungle roots and herbs, and are often successful in effecting cures when the regular native
doctors have failed. Their village priests have consequently a considerable reputation as skilled <a id="d0e2888"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2888">87</a>]</span>sorcerers and persons conversant with the unseen world. A case is known of a Br&#257;hman transferred to a jungle station, who
immediately after his arrival called in a Baiga priest and asked what forest gods he should worship, and what other steps
he should take to keep well and escape calamity. Colonel Ward states that in his time Baigas were commonly called in to give
aid when a town or village was attacked by cholera, and further that he had seen the greatest benefit to result from their
visit. For the people had so much confidence in their powers and ceremonies that they lost half their fright at once, and
were consequently not so much predisposed to an attack of the disease. On such an occasion the Baiga priest goes round the
village and pulls out a little straw from each house-roof, afterwards burning the whole before the shrine of Kherm&#257;ta, the
goddess of the village, to whom he also offers a chicken for each homestead. If this remedy fails goats are substituted for
chickens, and lastly, as a forlorn hope, pigs are tried, and, as a rule, do not fail, because by this time the disease may
be expected to have worked itself out. It is suggested that the chicken represents a human victim from each house, while the
straw stands for the house itself, and the offering has the common idea of a substituted victim.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e2890">
<h3>7. Appearance and mode of life.</h3>
<p>In stature the Baigas are a little taller than most other tribes, and though they have a tendency to the flat nose of the
Gonds, their foreheads and the general shape of their heads are of a better mould. Colonel Ward states that the members of
the tribe inhabiting the Maikal range in Mandla are a much finer race than those living nearer the open country.<a id="d0e2895src" href="#d0e2895" class="noteref">10</a> Their figures are very nearly perfect, says Colonel Bloomfield,<a id="d0e2900src" href="#d0e2900" class="noteref">11</a> and their wiry limbs, unburdened by superfluous flesh, will carry them over very great distances and over places inaccessible
to most human beings, while their compact bodies need no other nutriment than the scanty fare afforded by their native forests.
They are born hunters, hardy and active in the chase, and exceedingly bold and courageous. In character they are naturally
simple, honest and truthful, and when their fear of a stranger has been <a id="d0e2905"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2905">88</a>]</span>dissipated are most companionable folk. A small hut, 6 or 7 feet high at the ridge, made of split bamboos and mud, with a
neat veranda in front thatched with leaves and grass, forms the Baiga&#8217;s residence, and if it is burnt down, or abandoned on
a visitation of epidemic disease, he can build another in the space of a day. A rough earthen vessel to hold water, leaves
for plates, gourds for drinking-vessels, a piece of matting to sleep on, and a small axe, a sickle and a spear, exhaust the
inventory of the Baiga&#8217;s furniture, and the money value of the whole would not exceed a rupee.<a id="d0e2907src" href="#d0e2907" class="noteref">12</a> The Baigas never live in a village with other castes, but have their huts some distance away from the village in the jungle.
Unlike the other tribes also, the Baiga prefers his house to stand alone and at some little distance from those of his fellow-tribesmen.
While nominally belonging to the village near which they dwell, so separate and distinct are they from the rest of people
that in the famine of 1897 cases were found of starving Baiga hamlets only a few hundred yards away from the village proper
in which ample relief was being given. On being questioned as to why they had not caused the Baigas to be helped, the other
villagers said, &#8216;We did not remember them&#8217;; and when the Baigas were asked why they did not apply for relief, they said, &#8216;We
did not think it was meant for Baigas.&#8217;

<h3>8. Dress and food.</h3>
<p>Their dress is of the most simple description, a small strip of rag between the legs and another wisp for a head-covering
sufficing for the men, though the women are decently covered from their shoulders to half-way between the thighs and knees.
A Baiga may be known by his scanty clothing and tangled hair, and his wife by the way in which her single garment is arranged
so as to provide a safe sitting-place in it for her child. Baiga women have been seen at work in the field transplanting rice
with babies comfortably seated in their cloth, one sometimes supported on either hip with their arms and legs out, while the
mother was stooping low, hour after hour, handling the rice plants. A girl is tattooed on the forehead at the age of five,
and over her whole body before she is married, both for the sake of ornament and because the practice is considered beneficial
to the health. <a id="d0e2919"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2919">89</a>]</span>The Baigas are usually without blankets or warm clothing, and in the cold season they sleep round a wood fire kept burning
or smouldering all night, stray sparks from which may alight on their tough skins without being felt. Mr. Lampard relates
that on one occasion a number of Baiga men were supplied by the Mission under his charge with large new cloths to cover their
bodies with and make them presentable on appearance in church. On the second Sunday, however, they came with their cloths
burnt full of small holes; and they explained that the damage had been done at night while they were sleeping round the fire.

</p>
<p>A Baiga, Mr. Lampard continues, is speedily discerned in a forest village baz&#257;r, and is the most interesting object in it.
His almost nude figure, wild, tangled hair innocent of such inventions as brush or comb, lithe wiry limbs and jungly and uncivilised
appearance, mark him out at once. He generally brings a few mats or baskets which he has made, or fruits, roots, honey, horns
of animals, or other jungle products which he has collected, for sale, and with the sum obtained (a few pice or annas at the
most) he proceeds to make his weekly purchases, changing his pice into cowrie shells, of which he receives eighty for each
one. He buys tobacco, salt, chillies and other sundries, besides as much of kodon, kutki, or perhaps rice, as he can afford,
always leaving a trifle to be expended at the liquor shop before departing for home. The various purchases are tied up in
the corners of the bit of rag twisted round his head. Unlike pieces of cloth known to civilisation, which usually have four
corners, the Baiga&#8217;s headgear appears to be nothing but corners, and when the shopping is done the strip of rag may have a
dozen minute bundles tied up in it.

</p>
<p>In Baihar of B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t buying and selling are conducted on perhaps the most minute scale known, and if a Baiga has one or two
pice<a id="d0e2925src" href="#d0e2925" class="noteref">13</a> to lay out he will spend no inconsiderable time over it. Grain is sold in small measures holding about four ounces called
<i>baraiyas</i>, but each of these has a layer of mud at the bottom of varying degrees of thickness, so as to reduce its capacity. Before
a purchase can be made it must be settled by whose <i>baraiya</i> the grain is to be measured, and <a id="d0e2934"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2934">90</a>]</span>the seller and purchaser each refuse the other&#8217;s as being unfair to himself, until at length after discussion some neutral
person&#8217;s <i>baraiya</i> is selected as a compromise. Their food consists largely of forest fruits and roots with a scanty allowance of rice or the
light millets, and they can go without nourishment for periods which appear extraordinary to civilised man. They eat the flesh
of almost all animals, though the more civilised abjure beef and monkeys. They will take food from a Gond but not from a Br&#257;hman.
The Baiga dearly loves the common country liquor made from the mahua flower, and this is consumed as largely as funds will
permit of at weddings, funerals and other social gatherings, and also if obtainable at other times. They have a tribal <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee which imposes penalties for social offences, one punishment being the abstention from meat for a fixed period.
A girl going wrong with a man of the caste is punished by a fine, but cases of unchastity among unmarried Baiga girls are
rare. Among their pastimes dancing is one of the chief, and in their favourite dance, known as <i>karma</i>, the men and women form long lines opposite to each other with the musicians between them. One of the instruments, a drum
called <i>m&#257;ndar</i>, gives out a deep bass note which can be heard for miles. The two lines advance and retire, everybody singing at the same
time, and when the dancers get fully into the time and swing, the pace increases, the drums beat furiously, the voices of
the singers rise higher and higher, and by the light of the bonfires which are kept burning the whole scene is wild in the
extreme.

<div class="div2" id="d0e2948">
<h3>9. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The Baigas formerly practised only shifting cultivation, burning down patches of jungle and sowing seed on the ground fertilised
by the ashes after the breaking of the rains. Now that this method has been prohibited in Government forest, attempts have
been made to train them to regular cultivation, but with indifferent success in B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t. An idea of the difficulties to be
encountered may be obtained from the fact that in some villages the Baiga cultivators, if left unwatched, would dig up the
grain which they had themselves sown as seed in their fields and eat it; while the plough-cattle which were given to them
invariably developed diseases in spite of all precautions, as a result of <a id="d0e2953"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2953">91</a>]</span>which they found their way sooner or later to the Baiga&#8217;s cooking-pot. But they are gradually adopting settled habits, and
in Mandla, where a considerable block of forest was allotted to them in which they might continue their destructive practice
of shifting sowings, it is reported that the majority have now become regular cultivators. One explanation of their refusal
to till the ground is that they consider it a sin to lacerate the breast of their mother earth with a ploughshare. They also
say that God made the jungle to produce everything necessary for the sustenance of men and made the Baigas kings of the forest,
giving them wisdom to discover the things provided for them. To Gonds and others who had not this knowledge, the inferior
occupation of tilling the land was left. The men never become farmservants, but during the cultivating season they work for
hire at uprooting the rice seedlings for transplantation; they do no other agricultural labour for others. Women do the actual
transplantation of rice and work as harvesters. The men make bamboo mats and baskets, which they sell in the village weekly
markets. They also collect and sell honey and other forest products, and are most expert at all work that can be done with
an axe, making excellent woodcutters. But they show no aptitude in acquiring the use of any other implement, and dislike steady
continuous labour, preferring to do a few days&#8217; work and then rest in their homes for a like period before beginning again.
Their skill and dexterity in the use of the axe in hunting is extraordinary. Small deer, hares and peacocks are often knocked
over by throwing it at them, and panthers and other large animals are occasionally killed with a single blow. If one of two
Baigas is carried off by a tiger, the survivor will almost always make a determined and often successful attempt to rescue
him with nothing more formidable than an axe or a stick. They are expert trackers, and are also clever at setting traps and
snares, while, like Korkus, they catch fish by damming streams in the hot weather and throwing into the pool thus formed some
leaf or root which stupefies them. Even in a famine year, Mr. Low says, a Baiga can collect a large basketful of roots in
a single day; and if the bamboo seeds he is amply provided for. Nowadays Baiga cultivators may occasionally be met <a id="d0e2955"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2955">92</a>]</span>with who have taken to regular cultivation and become quite prosperous, owning a number of cattle.

<div class="div2" id="d0e2957">
<h3>10. Language.</h3>
<p>As already stated, the Baigas have completely forgotten their own language, and in the Satp&#363;ra hills they speak a broken form
of Hindi, though they have a certain number of words and expressions peculiar to the caste.

<h3>1. Definition of name and statistics.</h3>
<p><b>Bair&#257;gi</b>,<a id="d0e3037src" href="#d0e3037" class="noteref">1</a> <b>S&#257;dhu</b>.&#8212;The general term for members of the Vishnuite religious orders, who formerly as a rule lived by mendicancy. The Bair&#257;gis
have now, however, become a caste. In 1911 they numbered 38,000 persons in the Provinces, being distributed over all Districts
and States. The name Bair&#257;gi is supposed to come from the Sanskrit Vair&#257;gya and to signify one who is free from human passions.
Bair&#257;ga is also the term for the crutched stick which such mendicants frequently carry about with them and lean upon, either
sitting or standing, and which in case of need would serve them as a weapon. Platts considers<a id="d0e3049src" href="#d0e3049" class="noteref">2</a> that the name of the order comes from the Sanskrit abstract term, and the crutch therefore apparently obtained its name from
being used by members of the order. Properly, a religious mendicant of any Vishnuite sect should be called a Bair&#257;gi. But
the term is not generally applied to the more distinctive sects as the Kab&#299;rpanthi, Sw&#257;mi-N&#257;r&#257;yan, Satn&#257;mi and others, some
of which are almost separated from Hinduism, <a id="d0e3054"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3054">94</a>]</span>nor to the Sikh religious orders, nor the Chaitanya sect of Bengal. A proper Bair&#257;gi is one whose principal deity is either
Vishnu or either of his great incarnations, R&#257;ma and Krishna.

<h3>2. The four Samprad&#257;yas or main orders.</h3>
<p>It is generally held that there are four Samprad&#257;yas or main sects of Bair&#257;gis. These are&#8212;

</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The R&#257;m&#257;nujis, the followers of the first prominent Vishnuite reformer R&#257;m&#257;nuj in southern India, with whom are classed
the R&#257;m&#257;nandis or adherents of his great disciple R&#257;m&#257;nand in northern India. Both these are also called Sri Vaishnava, that
is, the principal or original Vaishnava sect.

</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The N&#299;m&#257;nandi, N&#299;m&#257;t or N&#299;mb&#257;ditya sect, followers of a saint called N&#299;m&#257;nand.

</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Vishnu-Sw&#257;mi or Vallabhach&#257;rya sect, worshippers of Krishna and R&#257;dha.

</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The M&#257;dhavach&#257;rya sect of southern India.

</p>
<p>It will be desirable to give a few particulars of each of these, mainly taken from Wilson&#8217;s <i>Hindu Sects</i> and Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya&#8217;s <i>Hindu Castes and Sects</i>.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3093">
<h3>3. The R&#257;m&#257;nujis.</h3>
<p>R&#257;m&#257;nuj was the first great Vishnuite prophet, and lived in southern India in the eleventh or twelfth century on an island
in the K&#257;veri river near Trichinopoly. He preached the worship of a supreme spirit, Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, and taught
that men also had souls or spirits, and that matter was lifeless. He was a strong opponent of the cult of Siva, then predominant
in southern India, and of phallic worship. He, however, admitted only the higher castes into his order, and cannot therefore
be considered as the founder of the liberalising principle of Vishnuism. The superiors of the R&#257;m&#257;nuja sect are called Ach&#257;rya,
and rank highest among the priests of the Vishnuite orders. The most striking feature in the practice of the R&#257;m&#257;nujis is
the separate preparation and scrupulous privacy of their meals. They must not eat in cotton garments, but must bathe, and
then put on wool or silk. The teachers allow their select pupils to assist them, but in general all the R&#257;m&#257;nujis cook for
themselves, and should the meal during this process, or while they are eating, attract even the look of a stranger, the operation
is instantly stopped and the viands buried in the <a id="d0e3098"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3098">95</a>]</span>ground. The R&#257;m&#257;nujis address each other with the salutation Dasoham, or &#8216;I am your slave,&#8217; accompanied with the Pran&#257;m or
slight inclination of the head and the application of joined hands to the forehead. To the Ach&#257;ryas or superiors the other
members of the sect perform the Ashtanga or prostration of the body with eight parts touching the ground. The <i>tilak</i> or sect-mark of the R&#257;m&#257;nujis consists of two perpendicular white lines from the roots of the hair to the top of the eyebrows,
with a connecting white line at the base, and a third central line either of red or yellow. The R&#257;m&#257;nujis do not recognise
the worship of R&#257;dha, the consort of Krishna. The mendicant orders of the S&#257;tanis and Dasaris of southern India are branches
of this sect.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3103">
<h3>4. The R&#257;m&#257;nandis</h3>
<p>R&#257;m&#257;nand, the great prophet of Vishnuism in northern India, and the real founder of the liberal doctrines of the cult, lived
at Ben&#257;res at the end of the fourteenth century, and is supposed to have been a follower of R&#257;m&#257;nuj. He introduced, however,
a great extension of his predecessor&#8217;s gospel in making his sect, nominally at least, open to all castes. He thus initiated
the struggle against the social tyranny and exclusiveness of the caste system, which was carried to greater lengths by his
disciples and successors, Kab&#299;r, N&#257;nak, D&#257;du, Rai D&#257;s and others. These afterwards proclaimed the worship of one unseen god
who could not be represented by idols, and the religious equality of all men, their tenets no doubt being considerably influenced
by their observance of Isl&#257;m, which had now become a principal religion of India. R&#257;m&#257;nand himself did not go so far, and
remained a good Hindu, inculcating the special worship of R&#257;ma and his consort S&#299;ta. The R&#257;ma&#257;andis consider the R&#257;m&#257;yana
as their most sacred book, and make pilgrimages to Ajodhia and R&#257;mnath.<a id="d0e3108src" href="#d0e3108" class="noteref">3</a> Their sect-mark consists of two white lines down the forehead with a red one between, but they are continued on to the nose,
ending in a loop, instead of terminating at the line of the eyebrows, like that of the R&#257;m&#257;nujis. The R&#257;m&#257;nandis say that
the mark on the nose represents the Sing&#257;sun or lion&#8217;s throne, while the two white lines up the forehead are R&#257;ma and Lakhshman,
and <a id="d0e3114"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3114">96</a>]</span>the centre red one is S&#299;ta. Some of their devotees wear ochre-coloured clothes like the Sivite mendicants.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3116">
<h3>5. The N&#299;m&#257;nandis.</h3>
<p>The second of the four orders is that of the N&#299;m&#257;nandis, called after a saint N&#299;m&#257;nand. He lived near Mathura Brind&#257;ban, and
on one occasion was engaged in religious controversy with a Jain ascetic till sunset. He then offered his visitor some refreshment,
but the Jain could not eat anything after sunset, so N&#299;m&#257;nand stopped the sun from setting, and ordered him to wait above
a <i>n&#299;m</i> tree till the meal was cooked and eaten under the tree, and this direction the sun duly obeyed. Hence N&#299;m&#257;nand, whose original
name was Bh&#257;skarach&#257;rya, was called by his new name after the tree, and was afterwards held to have been an incarnation of
Vishnu or the Sun.

</p>
<p>The doctrines of the sect, Mr. Growse states,<a id="d0e3126src" href="#d0e3126" class="noteref">4</a> are of a very enlightened character. Thus their tenet of salvation by faith is thought by many scholars to have been directly
derived from the Gospels; while another article in their creed is the continuance of conscious individual existence in a future
world, when the highest reward of the good will not be extinction, but the enjoyment of the visible presence of the divinity
whom they have served while on earth. The N&#299;m&#257;nandis worship Krishna, and were the first sect, Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya states,<a id="d0e3130src" href="#d0e3130" class="noteref">5</a> to associate with him as a divine consort R&#257;dha, the chief partner of his illicit loves.

</p>
<p>Their headquarters are at Muttra, and their chief festival is the Janam-Ashtami<a id="d0e3137src" href="#d0e3137" class="noteref">6</a> or Krishna&#8217;s birthday. Their sect-mark consists of two white lines down the forehead with a black patch in the centre, which
is called Shi&#257;mbindini. Shi&#257;m means black, and is a name of Krishna. They also sometimes have a circular line across the nose,
which represents the moon.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3140">
<h3>6. The M&#257;dhavach&#257;ryas.</h3>
<p>The third great order is that of the M&#257;dhavas, named after a saint called M&#257;dhavach&#257;rya in southern India. He attempted to
reconcile the warring Sivites and Vishnuites by combining the worship of Krishna with that of Siva <a id="d0e3145"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3145">97</a>]</span>and P&#257;rvati. The doctrine of the sect is that the human soul is different from the divine soul, and its members are therefore
called dualists. They admit a distinction between the divine soul and the universe, and between the human soul and the material
world. They deny also the possibility of Nirv&#257;na or the absorption and extinction of the human soul in the divine essence.
They destroy their thread at initiation, and also wear red clothes like the Sivite devotees, and like them also they carry
a staff and water-pot. The <i>tilak</i> of the M&#257;dhavach&#257;ryas is said to consist of two white lines down the forehead and continued on to the nose where they meet,
with a black vertical line between them.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3150">
<h3>7. The Vallabhach&#257;ryas.</h3>
<p>The fourth main order is the Vishnu-Sw&#257;mi, which is much better known as the Vallabhach&#257;rya sect, called after its founder
Vallabha, who was born in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1479. The god Krishna appeared to him and ordered him to marry and set up a shrine to the god at Gokul near Mathura (Muttra).
The sect worship Krishna in his character of B&#257;la Gop&#257;la or the cowherd boy. Their temples are numerous all over India, and
especially at Mathura and Brind&#257;ban, where Krishna was brought up as a cowherd. The temples at Ben&#257;res, Jagann&#257;th and Dw&#257;rka
are rich and important, but the most celebrated shrine is at Sri N&#257;thadw&#257;ra in Mew&#257;r. The image is said to have transported
itself thither from Mathura, when Aur&#257;ngzeb ordered its temple at Mathura to be destroyed. Krishna is here represented as
a little boy in the act of supporting the mountain Govardhan on his finger to shelter the people from the storms of rain sent
by Indra. The image is splendidly dressed and richly decorated with ornaments to the value of several thousand pounds. The
images of Krishna in the temples are commonly known as Th&#257;kurji, and are either of stone or brass. At all Vallabhach&#257;rya temples
there are eight daily services: the Mangala or morning <i>lev&eacute;e</i>, a little after sunrise, when the god is taken from his couch and bathed; the Sring&#257;ra, when he is attired in his jewels
and seated on his throne; the Gw&#257;la, when he is supposed to be starting to graze his cattle in the woods of Braj; the R&#257;j
Bhog or midday meal, which, after presentation, is consumed by the priests and votaries <a id="d0e3161"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3161">98</a>]</span>who have assisted at the ceremonies; the Utt&#257;pan, about three o&#8217;clock, when the god awakes from his siesta; the Bhog or evening
collation; the Sandhiya or disrobing at sunset; and the Sayan or retiring to rest. The ritual is performed by the priests
and the lay worshipper is only a spectator, who shows his reverence by the same forms as he would to a human superior.<a id="d0e3163src" href="#d0e3163" class="noteref">7</a>

</p>
<p>The priests of the sect are called Gokalastha Gosain or Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. They are considered to be incarnations of the god, and divine
honours are paid to them. They always marry, and avow that union with the god is best obtained by indulgence in all bodily
enjoyments. This doctrine has led to great licentiousness in some groups of the sect, especially on the part of the priests
or Mah&#257;r&#257;jas. Women were taught to believe that the service of and contact with the priest were the most real form of worshipping
the god, and that intercourse with him was equivalent to being united with the god. Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya quotes<a id="d0e3175src" href="#d0e3175" class="noteref">8</a> the following tariff for the privilege of obtaining different degrees of contact with the body of the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja or priest:

<p>The public disapprobation caused by these practices <a id="d0e3229"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3229">99</a>]</span>and their bad effect on the morality of women culminated in the great Mah&#257;r&#257;j libel suit in the Bombay High Court in 1862.
Since then the objectionable features of the cult have to a large extent disappeared, while it has produced some priests of
exceptional liberality and enlightenment. The <i>tilak</i> of the Vallabhach&#257;ryas is said to consist of two white lines down the forehead, forming a half-circle at its base and a white
dot between them. They will not admit the lower castes into the order, but only those from whom a Br&#257;hman can take water.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3234">
<h3>8. Minor sects.</h3>
<p>Besides the main sects as described above, Vaishnavism has produced many minor sects, consisting of the followers of some
saint of special fame, and mendicants belonging to these are included in the body of Bair&#257;gis. One or two legends concerning
such saints may be given. A common order is that of the Bendiw&#257;le, or those who wear a dot. Their founder began putting a
red dot on his forehead between the two white lines in place of the long red line of the R&#257;m&#257;nandis. His associates asked
him why he had dared to alter his <i>tilak</i> or sect-mark. He said that the goddess J&#257;nki had given him the dot, and as a test he went and bathed in the Sarju river,
and rubbed his forehead with water, and all the sect-mark was rubbed out except the dot. So the others recognised the special
intervention of the goddess, and he founded a sect. Another sect is called the Chaturbhuji or four-armed, Chaturbhuj being
an epithet of Vishnu. He was taking part in a feast when his loin-cloth came undone behind, and the others said to him that
as this had happened, he had become impure at the feast. He replied, &#8216;Let him to whom the <i>dhoti</i> belongs tie it up,&#8217; and immediately four arms sprang from his body, and while two continued to take food, the other two tied
up his loin-cloth behind. Thus it was recognised that the Chaturbhuji Vishnu had appeared in him, and he was venerated.

<h3>9. The seven Akh&#257;ras.</h3>
<p>Among the Bair&#257;gis, besides the four Samprad&#257;yas or main orders, there are seven Akh&#257;ras. These are military divisions or
schools for training, and were instituted when the Bair&#257;gis had to fight with the Gosains. Any member of one of the four Samprad&#257;yas
can belong to any one of the seven Akh&#257;ras, and a man can change his Akh&#257;ra as <a id="d0e3250"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3250">100</a>]</span>often as he likes, but not his Samprad&#257;ya. The Akh&#257;ras, with the exception of the Lasgaris, who change the red centre line
of the R&#257;man&#257;ndis into a white line, have no special sect-marks. They are distinguished by their flags or standards, which
are elaborately decorated with gold thread embroidered on silk or sometimes with jewels, and cost two or three hundred rupees
to prepare. These standards were carried by the N&#257;ga or naked members of the Akh&#257;ra, who went in front and fought. Once in
twelve years a great meeting of all the seven Akh&#257;ras is held at Allah&#257;b&#257;d, N&#257;sik, Ujjain or Hardw&#257;r, where they bathe and
wash the image of the god in the water of the holy rivers. The quarrels between the Bair&#257;gis and Gosains usually occurred
at the sacred rivers, and the point of contention was which sect should bathe first. The following is a list of the seven
Akh&#257;ras: Digambari, Kh&#257;ki, Munjia, Kathia, Nirmohi, Nirb&#257;ni or Niranjani and Lasgari.


</p>
<div id="d0e3252" class="figure"><img border="0" src="images/p100.jpg" alt="Pilgrims carrying water of the river Nerbudda." width="720" height="446"><p class="figureHead">Pilgrims carrying water of the river Nerbudda.</p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p>The name of the Digamber or Meghdamber signifies sky-clad or cloud-clad, that is naked. They do penance in the rainy season
by sitting naked in the rain for two or three hours a day with an earthen pot on the head and the hands inserted in two others
so that they cannot rub the skin. In the dry season they wear only a little cloth round the waist and ashes over the rest
of the body. The ashes are produced from burnt cowdung picked up off the ground, and not mixed with straw like that which
is prepared for fuel.

</p>
<p>The Kh&#257;ki Bair&#257;gis also rub ashes on the body. During the four hot months they make five fires in a circle, and kneel between
them with the head and legs and arms stretched towards the fires. The fires are kindled at noon with little heaps of cowdung
cakes, and the penitent stays between them till they go out. They also have a block of wood with a hole through it, into which
they insert the organ of generation and suspend it by chains in front and behind. They rub ashes on the body, from which they
probably get their name of Kh&#257;ki or dust-colour.

</p>
<p>The Munjia Akh&#257;ra have a belt made of <i>munj</i> grass round the waist, and a little apron also of grass, which is hung from it, and passed through the legs. Formerly they
<a id="d0e3265"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3265">101</a>]</span>wore no other clothes, but now they have a cloth. They also do penance between the fires.

</p>
<p>The Kathias have a waist-belt of bamboo fibre, to which is suspended the wooden block for the purpose already described. Their
name signifies wooden, and is probably given to them on account of this custom.

</p>
<p>The Nirmohi carry a <i>lota</i> or brass vessel and a little cup, in which they receive alms.

</p>
<p>The Nirb&#257;ni wear only a piece of string or rope round the waist, to which is attached a small strip of cloth passing through
the legs. When begging, they carry a <i>kawar</i> or banghy, holding two baskets covered with cloth, and into this they put all their alms. They never remove the cloth, but
plunge their hands into the basket at random when they want something to eat. They call the basket K&#257;mdhenu, the name of the
cow which gave inexhaustible wealth. These Bair&#257;gis commonly marry and accumulate property.

</p>
<p>The Lasgari are soldiers, as the name denotes.<a id="d0e3281src" href="#d0e3281" class="noteref">9</a> They wear three straight lines of sandalwood up the forehead. It is said that on one occasion the Bair&#257;gis were suddenly
attacked by the Gosains when they had only made the white lines of the sect-mark, and they fought as they were. In consequence
of this, they have ever since worn three white lines and no red one.

</p>
<p>Others say that the Lasgari are a branch of the Digambari Akh&#257;ra, and that the Munjia and Kathia are branches of the Kh&#257;ki
Akh&#257;ra. They give three other Akh&#257;ras&#8212;N&#299;ralankhi, Mah&#257;nirb&#257;ni and Santokhi&#8212;about which nothing is known.

<div class="div2" id="d0e3289">
<h3>10. The Dw&#257;ras.</h3>
<p>Besides the Akh&#257;ras, the Bair&#257;gis are said to have fifty-two Dw&#257;ras or doors, and every man must be a member of a Dw&#257;ra as
well as of a Samprad&#257;ya and Akh&#257;ra. The Dw&#257;ras seem to have no special purpose, but in the case of Bair&#257;gis who marry, they
now serve as exogamous sections, so that members of the same Dw&#257;ra do not intermarry.

<div class="div2" id="d0e3298">
<h3>11. Initiation, appearance and customs.</h3>
<p>A candidate for initiation has his head shaved, is invested with a necklace of beads of the <i>tulsi</i> or basil, and is taught a <i>mantra</i> or text relating to Vishnu by his preceptor. The initiation text of the R&#257;m&#257;nandis is said to be <i>Om R&#257;m&#257;ya <a id="d0e3311"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3311">102</a>]</span>N&#257;mah</i>, or <i>Om</i>, Salutation to R&#257;ma. <i>Om</i> is a very sacred syllable, having much magical power. Thereafter the novice must journey to Dw&#257;rka in Gujar&#257;t and have his
body branded with hot iron or copper in the shape of Vishnu&#8217;s four implements: the <i>chakra</i> or discus, the <i>guda</i> or club, the <i>shank</i> or conch-shell and the <i>padma</i> or lotus. Sometimes these are not branded but are made daily on the arms with clay. The sect-mark should be made with Gopichandan
or the milkmaid&#8217;s sandalwood. This is supposed to be clay taken from a tank at Dw&#257;rka, in which the Gopis or milkmaids who
had been Krishna&#8217;s companions drowned themselves when they heard of his death. But as this can seldom be obtained any suitable
whitish clay is used instead. The Bair&#257;gis commonly let their hair grow long, after being shaved at initiation, to imitate
the old forest ascetics. If a man makes a pilgrimage on foot to some famous shrine he may have his head shaved there and make
an offering of his hair. Others keep their hair long and shave it only at the death of their <i>guru</i> or preceptor. They usually wear white clothes, and if a man has a cloth on the upper part of the body it should be folded
over the shoulders and knotted at the neck. He also has a <i>chimta</i> or small pair of tongs, and, if he can obtain it, the skin of an Indian antelope, on which he will sit while taking his food.
The skin of this animal is held to be sacred. Every Bair&#257;gi before he takes his food should dip a sprig of <i>tulsi</i> or basil into it to sanctify it, and if he cannot get this he uses his necklace of <i>tulsi</i>-beads for the purpose instead. The caste abstain from flesh and liquor, but are addicted to the intoxicating drugs, <i>g&#257;nja</i> and <i>bh&#257;ng</i> or preparations of Indian hemp. A Hindu on meeting a Bair&#257;gi will greet him with the phrase &#8216;Jai S&#299;t&#257;r&#257;m,&#8217; and the Bair&#257;gi
will answer, &#8216;S&#299;t&#257;r&#257;m.&#8217; This word is a conjunction of the names of R&#257;ma and his consort S&#299;ta. When a Bair&#257;gi receives alms
he will present to the giver a flower and a sprig of <i>tulsi</i>.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3353">
<h3>12. Recruitment of the order and its character.</h3>
<p>A man belonging to any caste except the impure ones can be initiated as a Bair&#257;gi, and the order is to a large extent recruited
from the lower castes. Theoretically all members of the order should eat together; but the Br&#257;hmans and other high castes
belonging to it now eat only <a id="d0e3358"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3358">103</a>]</span>among themselves, except on the occasion of a Ghosti or special religious assembly, when all eat in common. As a matter of
fact the order is a very mixed assortment of people. Many persons who lost their caste in the famine of 1897 from eating in
Government poor-houses, joined the order and obtained a respectable position. Debtors who have become hopelessly involved
sometimes find in it a means of escape from their creditors. Women of bad character, who have been expelled from their caste,
are also frequently enrolled as female members, and in monasteries live openly with the men. The caste is also responsible
for a good deal of crime. Not only is the disguise a very convenient one for thieves and robbers to assume on their travels,
but many regular members of the order are criminally disposed. Nevertheless large numbers of Bair&#257;gis are men who have given
up their caste and families from a genuine impulse of self-sacrifice, and the desire to lead a religious life.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3360">
<h3>13. Social position and customs.</h3>
<p>On account of their sanctity the Bair&#257;gis have a fairly good social position, and respectable Hindu castes will accept cooked
food from them. Br&#257;hmans usually, but not always, take water. They act as <i>gurus</i> or spiritual guides to the laymen of all castes who can become Bair&#257;gis. They give the R&#257;m and Gop&#257;l Mantras, or the texts
of R&#257;ma and Krishna, to their disciples of the three twice-born castes, and the Sheo Mantra or Siva&#8217;s text to other castes.
The last is considered to be of smaller religious efficacy than the others, and is given to the lower castes and members of
the higher ones who do not lead a particularly virtuous life. They invest boys with the sacred thread, and make the sect-mark
on their foreheads. When they go and visit their disciples they receive presents, but do not ask them to confess their sins
nor impose penalties.

</p>
<p>If a mendicant Bair&#257;gi keeps a woman it is stated that he is expelled from the community, but this rule does not seem to be
enforced in practice. If he is detected in a casual act of sexual intercourse a fine should be imposed, such as feeding two
or three hundred Bair&#257;gis. The property of an unmarried Bair&#257;gi descends to a selected <i>chela</i> or disciple. The bodies of the dead are usually burnt, <a id="d0e3373"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3373">104</a>]</span>but those of saints specially famous for their austerities or piety are buried, and salt is put round the body to preserve
it. Such men are known as Bhakta.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3375">
<h3>14. Bair&#257;gi monasteries.</h3>
<p>The Bair&#257;gis<a id="d0e3380src" href="#d0e3380" class="noteref">10</a> have numerous <i>maths</i> or monasteries, scattered over the country and usually attached to temples. The Math comprises a set of huts or chambers
for the Mahant or superior and his permanent pupils; a temple and often the Sam&#257;dhi or tomb of the founder, or of some eminent
Mahant; and a Dharms&#257;la or charitable hostel for the accommodation of wandering members of the order, and of other travellers
who are constantly visiting the temple. Ingress and egress are free to all, and, indeed, a restraint on personal liberty seems
never to have entered into the conception of any Hindu religious legislator. There are, as a rule, a small number of resident
<i>chelas</i> or disciples who are scholars and attendants on the superiors, and also out-members who travel over the country and return
to the monastery as a headquarters. The monastery has commonly some small endowment in land, and the resident <i>chelas</i> go out and beg for alms for their common support. If the Mahant is married the headship may descend in his family; but when
he is unmarried his successor is one of his disciples, who is commonly chosen by election at a meeting of the Mahants of neighbouring
monasteries. Formerly the Hindu governor of the district would preside at such an election, but it is now, of course, left
entirely to the Bair&#257;gis themselves.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3395">
<h3>15. Married Bair&#257;gis.</h3>
<p>Large numbers of Bair&#257;gis now marry and have children, and have formed an ordinary caste. The married Bair&#257;gis are held to
be inferior to the celibate mendicants, and will take food from them, but the mendicants will not permit the married Bair&#257;gis
to eat with them in the <i>chauka</i> or place purified for the taking of food. The customs of the married Bair&#257;gis resemble those of ordinary Hindu castes such
as the Kurmis. They permit divorce and the remarriage of widows, and burn the dead. Those who have taken to cultivation do
not, as a rule, plough with their own hands. Many Bair&#257;gis have acquired property and become <a id="d0e3403"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3403">105</a>]</span>landholders, and others have extensive moneylending transactions. Two such men who had acquired possession of extensive tracts
of zam&#299;nd&#257;ri land in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, in satisfaction of loans made to the Gond zam&#299;nd&#257;rs, and had been given the zam&#299;nd&#257;ri status
by the Mar&#257;thas, were subsequently made Feudatory Chiefs of the N&#257;ndgaon and Chhuikhadan States. These chiefs now marry and
the States descend in their families by primogeniture in the ordinary manner. As a rule, the Bair&#257;gi landowners and moneylenders
are not found to be particularly good specimens of their class.

</span><h2>Bal&#257;hi</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3408">
<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Bal&#257;hi.</b><a id="d0e3414src" href="#d0e3414" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A low functional caste of weavers and village watchmen found in the Nim&#257;r and Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d Districts and in Central India.
They numbered 52,000 persons in the Central Provinces in 1911, being practically confined to the two Districts already mentioned.
The name is a corruption of the Hindi <i>bul&#257;hi</i>, one who calls, or a messenger. The Bal&#257;his seem to be an occupational group, probably an offshoot of the large Kori caste
of weavers, one of whose subdivisions is shown as Bal&#257;hi in the United Provinces. In the Central Provinces they have received
accretions from the spinner caste of Katias, themselves probably a branch of the Koris, and from the Mah&#257;rs, the great menial
caste of Bombay. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d they are known alternatively as Mah&#257;r, while in Burh&#257;npur they are called Bunkar or weaver
by outsiders. The following story which they tell about themselves also indicates their mixed origin. They say that their
ancestors came to Nim&#257;r as part of the army of R&#257;ja M&#257;n of Jodhpur, who invaded the country when it was under Muhammadan rule.
He was defeated, and his soldiers were captured and ordered to be killed.<a id="d0e3420src" href="#d0e3420" class="noteref">2</a> One of the Bal&#257;his among them won the favour of the Muhammadan general and asked for his own freedom and that of the other
Bal&#257;his from among the prisoners. The Musalm&#257;n <a id="d0e3423"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3423">106</a>]</span>replied that he would be unable to determine which of the prisoners were really Bal&#257;his. On this the Bal&#257;hi, whose name was
Ganga Kochla, replied that he had an effective test. He therefore killed a cow, cooked its flesh and invited the prisoners
to partake of it. So many of them as consented to eat were considered to be Bal&#257;his and liberated; but many members of other
castes thus obtained their freedom, and they and their descendants are now included in the community. The subcastes or endogamous
groups distinctly indicate the functional character of the caste, the names given being Nim&#257;ri, Gannore, Katia, Kori and Mah&#257;r.
Of these Katia, Kori and Mah&#257;r are the names of distinct castes, Nim&#257;ri is a local subdivision indicating those who speak
the peculiar dialect of this tract, and the Gannore are no doubt named after the R&#257;jp&#363;t clan of that name, of whom their ancestors
were not improbably the illegitimate offspring. The Nim&#257;ri Bal&#257;his are said to rank lower than the rest, as they will eat
the flesh of dead cattle which the others refuse to do. They may not take water from the village well, and unless a separate
one can be assigned to them, must pay others to draw water for them. Partly no doubt in the hope of escaping from this degraded
position, many of the Nim&#257;ri group became Christians in the famine of 1897. They are considered to be the oldest residents
of Nim&#257;r. At marriages the Bal&#257;hi receives as his perquisite the leaf-plates used for feasts with the leavings of food upon
them; and at funerals he takes the cloth which covers the corpse on its way to the burning-<i>gh&#257;t</i>. In Nim&#257;r the Korkus and Bal&#257;his each have a separate burying-ground which is known as Murgh&#257;ta.<a id="d0e3428src" href="#d0e3428" class="noteref">3</a> The Katias weave the finer kinds of cloth and rank a little higher than the others. In Burh&#257;npur, as already stated, the
caste are known as Bunkar, and they are probably identical with the Bunkars of Kh&#257;ndesh; Bunkar is simply an occupational
term meaning a weaver.

<div class="div2" id="d0e3434">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>The caste have the usual system of exogamous groups, some of which are named after villages, while the designations of others
are apparently nicknames given to the founder of the clan, as Bagm&#257;r, a tiger-killer, Bhagoria, a runaway, <a id="d0e3439"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3439">107</a>]</span>and so on. They employ a Br&#257;hman to calculate the horoscopes of a bridal couple and fix the date of their wedding, but if
he says the marriage is inauspicious, they merely obtain the permission of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> and celebrate it on a Saturday or Sunday. Apparently, however, they do not consult real Br&#257;hmans, but merely priests of their
own caste whom they call Bal&#257;hi Br&#257;hmans. These Br&#257;hmans are, nevertheless, said to recite the Satya N&#257;r&#257;yan Katha. They also
have <i>gurus</i> or spiritual preceptors, being members of the caste who have joined the mendicant orders; and Bh&#257;ts or genealogists of their
own caste who beg at their weddings. They have the practice of serving for a wife, known as Gharjamai or Lamjhana. When the
pauper suitor is finally married at the expense of his wife&#8217;s father, a marriage-shed is erected for him at the house of some
neighbour, but his own family are not invited to the wedding.

</p>
<p>After marriage a girl goes to her husband&#8217;s house for a few days and returns. The first Diw&#257;li or Akha-t&#299;j festival after
the wedding must also be passed at the husband&#8217;s house, but consummation is not effected until the <i>aina</i> or <i>gauna</i> ceremony is performed on the attainment of puberty. The cost of a wedding is about Rs. 80 to the bridegroom&#8217;s family and
Rs. 20 to the bride&#8217;s family. A widow is forbidden to marry her late husband&#8217;s brother or other relatives. At the wedding
she is dressed in new clothes, and the foreheads of the couple are marked with cowdung as a sign of purification. They then
proceed by night to the husband&#8217;s village, and the woman waits till morning in some empty building, when she enters her husband&#8217;s
house carrying two water-pots on her head in token of the fertility which she is to bring to it.

<h3>3. Other customs.</h3>
<p>Like the Mah&#257;rs, the Bal&#257;his must not kill a dog or a cat under pain of expulsion; but it is peculiar that in their case the
bear is held equally sacred, this being probably a residue of some totemistic observance. The most binding form of oath which
they can use is by any one of these animals. The Bal&#257;his will admit any Hindu into the community except a man of the very
lowest castes, and also Gonds and Korkus. The head and face of the neophyte <a id="d0e3460"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3460">108</a>]</span>are shaved clean, and he is made to lie on the ground under a string-cot; a number of the Bal&#257;his sit on this and wash themselves,
letting the water drip from their bodies on to the man below until he is well drenched; he then gives a feast to the caste-fellows,
and is considered to have become a Bal&#257;hi. It is reported also that they will receive back into the community Bal&#257;hi women
who have lived with men of other castes and even with Jains and Muhammadans. They will take food from members of these religions
and of any Hindu caste, except the most impure.

</span><h2>Balija</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3465">
<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Balija, Balji, Gurusthulu, Naidu.</b>&#8212;A large trading caste of the Madras Presidency, where they number a million persons. In the Central Provinces 1200 were enumerated
in 1911, excluding 1500 Perikis, who though really a subcaste and not a very exalted one of Balijas,<a id="d0e3472src" href="#d0e3472" class="noteref">1</a> claim to be a separate caste. They are mainly returned from places where Madras troops have been stationed, as N&#257;gpur, Jubbulpore
and Raipur. The caste are frequently known as Naidu, a corruption of the Telugu word N&#257;yakdu, a prince or leader. Their ancestors
are supposed to have been N&#257;yaks or kings of Madura, Tanjore and Vijayanagar. The traditional occupation of the caste appears
to have been to make bangles and pearl and coral ornaments, and they have still a subcaste called G&#257;zulu, or a bangle-seller.
In Madras they are said to be an offshoot of the great cultivating castes of Kamma and K&#257;pu and to be a mixed community recruited
from these and other Telugu castes. Another proof of their mixed descent may be inferred from the fact that they will admit
persons of other castes or the descendants of mixed marriages into the community without much scruple in Madras.<a id="d0e3477src" href="#d0e3477" class="noteref">2</a> The name of Balija seems also to have been applied to a mixed caste started by B&#257;sava, the founder of the Ling&#257;yat sect of
Sivites, these persons being known in Madras as Linga Balijas.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3482">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>The Balijas have two main divisions, Desa or Kota, and Peta, the Desas or Kotas being those who claim descent from the old
Balija kings, while the Petas are the trading Balijas, and are further subdivided into groups like the G&#257;zulu or <a id="d0e3487"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3487">109</a>]</span>bangle-sellers and the Periki or salt-sellers. The subdivisions are not strictly endogamous. Every family has a surname, and
exogamous groups or <i>gotras</i> also exist, but these have generally been forgotten, and marriages are regulated by the surnames, the only prohibition being
that persons of the same surname may not intermarry. Instances of such names are: Singiri, G&#363;d&#257;ri, Jadal, Sangn&#257;d and D&#257;siri.
In fact the rules of exogamy are so loose that an instance is known of an uncle having married his niece. Marriage is usually
infant, and the ceremony lasts for five days. On the first day the bride and bridegroom are seated on a yoke in the <i>pandal</i> or marriage pavilion, where the relatives and guests assemble. The bridegroom puts a pair of silver rings on the bride&#8217;s
toes and ties the <i>mangal-s&#363;tram</i> or flat circular piece of gold round her neck. On the next three days the bridegroom and bride are made to sit on a plank
or cot face to face with each other and to throw flowers and play together for two hours in the mornings and evenings. On
the fourth day, at dead of night, they are seated on a cot and the jewels and gifts for the bride are presented, and she is
then formally handed over to the bridegroom&#8217;s family. In Madras Mr. Thurston<a id="d0e3498src" href="#d0e3498" class="noteref">3</a> states that on the last day of the marriage ceremony a mock ploughing and sowing rite is held, and during this, the sister
of the bridegroom puts a cloth over the basket containing earth, wherein seeds are to be sown by the bridegroom, and will
not allow him to go on with the ceremony till she has extracted a promise that his first-born daughter shall marry her son.
No bride-price is paid, and the remarriage of widows is forbidden.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3503">
<h3>3. Occupation and social status.</h3>
<p>The Balijas bury their dead in a sitting posture. In the Central Provinces they are usually Ling&#257;yats and especially worship
Gauri, Siva&#8217;s wife. Jangams serve them as priests. They usually eat flesh and drink liquor, but in Ch&#257;nda it is stated that
both these practices are forbidden. In the Central Provinces they are mainly cultivators, but some of them still sell bangles
and salt. Several of them are in Government service and occupy a fairly high social position.

</p>
<p>In Madras a curious connection exists between the K&#257;pus and Balijas and the impure M&#257;la caste. It is said <a id="d0e3510"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3510">110</a>]</span>that once upon a time the K&#257;pus and Balijas were flying from the Muhammadans and came to the northern Pall&#257;r river in high
flood. They besought the river to go down and let them across, but it demanded the sacrifice of a first-born child. While
the K&#257;pus and Balijas were hesitating, the M&#257;las who had followed them boldly sacrificed one of their children. Immediately
the river divided before them and they all crossed in safety. Ever since then the K&#257;pus and Balijas have respected the M&#257;las,
and the Balijas formerly even deposited the images of the goddess Gauri, of Ganesha, and of Siva&#8217;s bull with the M&#257;las, as
the hereditary custodians of their gods.<a id="d0e3512src" href="#d0e3512" class="noteref">4</a>

<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Bania, B&#257;ni, V&#257;ni, Mah&#257;jan, Seth, S&#257;huk&#257;r.</b>&#8212;The occupational caste of bankers, moneylenders and dealers in <a id="d0e3705"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3705">112</a>]</span>grain, <i>gh&#299;</i> (butter), groceries and spices. The name Bania is derived from the Sanskrit <i>vanij</i>, a merchant. In western India the Banias are always called V&#257;nia or V&#257;ni. Mah&#257;jan literally means a great man, and being
applied to successful Banias as an honorific title has now come to signify a banker or moneylender; Seth signifies a great
merchant or capitalist, and is applied to Banias as an honorific prefix. The words <i>S&#257;hu</i>, <i>Sao</i> and <i>S&#257;huk&#257;r</i> mean upright or honest, and have also, curiously enough, come to signify a moneylender. The total number of Banias in the
Central Provinces in 1911 was about 200,000, or rather over one per cent of the population. Of the above total two-thirds
were Hindus and one-third Jains. The caste is fairly distributed over the whole Province, being most numerous in Districts
with large towns and a considerable volume of trade.

</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3726">
<h3>2. The Banias a true caste: use of the name.</h3>
<p>There has been much difference of opinion as to whether the name Bania should be taken to signify a caste, or whether it is
merely an occupational term applied to a number of distinct castes. I venture to think it is necessary and scientifically
correct to take it as a caste. In Bengal the word Banian, a corruption of Bania, has probably come to be a general term meaning
simply a banker, or person dealing in money. But this does not seem to be the case elsewhere. As a rule the name Bania is
used only as a caste name for groups who are considered both by themselves and outsiders to belong to the Bania caste. It
may occasionally be applied to members of other castes, as in the case of certain Teli-Banias who have abandoned oil-pressing
for shop-keeping, but such instances are very rare; and these Telis would probably now assert that they belonged to the Bania
caste. That the Banias are recognised as a distinct caste by the people is shown by the number of uncomplimentary proverbs
and sayings about them, which is far larger than in the case of any other caste.<a id="d0e3731src" href="#d0e3731" class="noteref">1</a> In all these the name Bania is used and not that of any subdivision, and this indicates that none of the subdivisions are
looked upon as distinctive social groups or castes. Moreover, so far as I am aware, the name Bania is applied regularly to
all the groups usually classified under the caste, and there is no <a id="d0e3737"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3737">113</a>]</span>group which objects to the name or whose members refuse to describe themselves by it. This is by no means always the case
with other important castes. The R&#257;thor Telis of Mandla entirely decline to answer to the name of Teli, though they are classified
under that caste. In the case of the important Ah&#299;r or grazier caste, those who sell milk instead of grazing cattle are called
Gaoli, but remain members of the Ah&#299;r caste. An Ah&#299;r in Chhatt&#299;sgarh would be called R&#257;wat and in the Maratha Districts Gow&#257;ri,
but might still be an Ah&#299;r by caste. The Barai caste of betel-vine growers and sellers is in some localities called Tamboli
and not Barai; elsewhere it is known only as Pans&#257;ri, though the name Pans&#257;ri is correctly an occupational term, and, where
it is not applied to the Barais, means a grocer or druggist by profession and not a caste. Bania, on the other hand, over
the greater part of India is applied only to persons who acknowledge themselves and are generally recognised by Hindu society
to be members of the Bania caste, and there is no other name which is generally applied to any considerable section of such
persons. Certain of the more important subcastes of Bania, as the Agarw&#257;la, Osw&#257;l and Parw&#257;r, are, it is true, frequently
known by the subcaste name. But the caste name is as often as not, or even more often, affixed to it. Agarw&#257;la, or Agarw&#257;la
Bania, are names equally applied to designate this subcaste, and similarly with the Osw&#257;ls and Parw&#257;rs; and even so the subcaste
name is only applied for greater accuracy and for compliment, since these are the best subcastes; the Bania&#8217;s quarter of a
town will be called Bania Mahalla, and its residents spoken of as Banias, even though they may be nearly all Agarw&#257;ls or Osw&#257;ls.
Several R&#257;jp&#363;t clans are similarly spoken of by their clan names, as R&#257;thor, Panw&#257;r, and so on, without the addition of the
caste name R&#257;jp&#363;t. Br&#257;hman subcastes are usually mentioned by their subcaste name for greater accuracy, though in their case
too it is usual to add the caste name. And there are subdivisions of other castes, such as the Jaisw&#257;r Cham&#257;rs and the Somvansi
Mehras, who invariably speak of themselves only by their subcaste name, and discard the caste name altogether, being ashamed
of it, but are nevertheless held to belong to their parent castes. Thus in the <a id="d0e3739"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3739">114</a>]</span>matter of common usage Bania conforms in all respects to the requirements of a proper caste name.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3741">
<h3>3. Their distinctive occupation.</h3>
<p>The Banias have also a distinct and well-defined traditional occupation,<a id="d0e3746src" href="#d0e3746" class="noteref">2</a> which is followed by many or most members of practically every subcaste so far as has been observed. This occupation has
caused the caste as a body to be credited with special mental and moral characteristics in popular estimation, to a greater
extent perhaps than any other caste. None of the subcastes are ashamed of their traditional occupation or try to abandon it.
It is true that a few subcastes such as the Kasaundhans and Kasarw&#257;nis, sellers of metal vessels, apparently had originally
a somewhat different profession, though resembling the traditional one; but they too, if they once only sold vessels, now
engage largely in the traditional Bania&#8217;s calling, and deal generally in grain and money. The Banias, no doubt because it
is both profitable and respectable, adhere more generally to their traditional occupation than almost any great caste, except
the cultivators. Mr. Marten&#8217;s analysis<a id="d0e3749src" href="#d0e3749" class="noteref">3</a> of the occupations of different castes shows that sixty per cent of the Banias are still engaged in trade; while only nineteen
per cent of Br&#257;hmans follow a religious calling; twenty-nine per cent of Ah&#299;rs are graziers, cattle-dealers or milkmen; only
nine per cent of Telis are engaged in all branches of industry, including their traditional occupation of oil-pressing; and
similarly only twelve per cent of Cham&#257;rs work at industrial occupations, including that of curing hides. In respect of occupation
therefore the Banias strictly fulfil the definition of a caste.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3754">
<h3>4. Their distinctive status.</h3>
<p>The Banias have also a distinctive social status. They are considered, though perhaps incorrectly, to represent the Vaishyas
or third great division of the Aryan twice-born; they rank just below R&#257;jp&#363;ts and perhaps above all other castes except Br&#257;hmans;
Br&#257;hmans will take food cooked without water from many Banias and drinking-water from all. Nearly all Banias wear the sacred
thread; and the Banias are distinguished by the fact that they abstain more rigorously and generally from all kinds of flesh
food than <a id="d0e3759"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3759">115</a>]</span>any other caste. Their rules as to diet are exceptionally strict, and are equally observed by the great majority of the subdivisions.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3761">
<h3>5. The endogamous divisions of the Banias.</h3>
<p>Thus the Banias apparently fulfil the definition of a caste, as consisting of one or more endogamous groups or subcastes with
a distinct name applied to them all and to them only, a distinctive occupation and a distinctive social status; and there
seems no reason for not considering them a caste. If on the other hand we examine the subcastes of Bania we find that the
majority of them have names derived from places,<a id="d0e3766src" href="#d0e3766" class="noteref">4</a> not indicating any separate origin, occupation or status, but only residence in separate tracts. Such divisions are properly
termed subcastes, being endogamous only, and in no other way distinctive. No subcaste can be markedly distinguished from the
others in respect of occupation or social status, and none apparently can therefore be classified as a separate caste. There
are no doubt substantial differences in status between the highest subcastes of Bania, the Agarw&#257;ls, Osw&#257;ls and Parw&#257;rs, and
the lower ones, the Kasaundhan, Kasarw&#257;ni, Dosar and others. But this difference is not so great as that which separates different
groups included in such important castes as R&#257;jp&#363;t and Bh&#257;t. It is true again that subcastes like the Agarw&#257;ls and Osw&#257;ls
are individually important, but not more so than the Mar&#257;tha, Khedaw&#257;l, Kanaujia and Maithil Br&#257;hmans, or the Sesodia, R&#257;thor,
Panw&#257;r and J&#257;don R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The higher subcastes of Bania themselves recognise a common relationship by taking food cooked without
water from each other, which is a very rare custom among subcastes. Some of them are even said to have intermarried. If on
the other hand it is argued, not that two or three or more of the important subdivisions should be erected into independent
castes, but that Bania is not a caste at all, and that every subcaste should be treated as a separate caste, then such purely
local groups as Kanaujia, Jaisw&#257;r, Gujar&#257;ti, Jaunpuri and others, which are found in forty or fifty other castes, would have
to become separate <a id="d0e3769"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3769">116</a>]</span>castes; and if in this one case why not in all the other castes where they occur? This would result in the impossible position
of having forty or fifty castes of the same name, which recognise no connection of any kind with each other, and make any
arrangement or classification of castes altogether impracticable. And in 1911 out of 200,000 Banias in the Central Provinces,
43,000 were returned with no subcaste at all, and it would therefore be impossible to classify these under any other name.

<h3>6. The Banias derived from the R&#257;jp&#363;ts.</h3>
<p>The Banias have been commonly supposed to represent the Vaishyas or third of the four classical castes, both by Hindu society
generally and by leading authorities on the subject. It is perhaps this view of their origin which is partly responsible for
the tendency to consider them as several castes and not one. But its accuracy is doubtful. The important Bania groups appear
to be of R&#257;jp&#363;t stock. They nearly all come from R&#257;jput&#257;na, Bundelkhand or Gujar&#257;t, that is from the homes of the principal
R&#257;j&#363;t clans. Several of them have legends of R&#257;jp&#363;t descent. The Agarw&#257;las say that their first ancestor was a Kshatriya king,
who married a N&#257;ga or snake princess; the N&#257;ga race is supposed to have signified the Scythian immigrants, who were snake-worshippers
and from whom several clans of R&#257;jp&#363;ts were probably derived. The Agarw&#257;las took their name from the ancient city of Agroha
or possibly from Agra. The Osw&#257;ls say that their ancestor was the R&#257;jp&#363;t king of Osnagar in M&#257;rw&#257;r, who with his followers
was converted by a Jain mendicant. The Nemas state that their ancestors were fourteen young R&#257;jp&#363;t princes who escaped the
vengeance of Parasur&#257;ma by abandoning the profession of arms and taking to trade. The Khandelw&#257;ls take their name from the
town of Khandela in Jaipur State of R&#257;jput&#257;na. The Kasarw&#257;nis say they immigrated from Kara M&#257;nikpur in Bundelkhand. The origin
of the Umre Banias is not known, but in Gujar&#257;t they are also called B&#257;garia from the B&#257;gar or wild country of the Dongarpur
and Pert&#257;bgarh States of R&#257;jput&#257;na, where numbers of them are still settled; the name B&#257;garia would appear to indicate that
they are supposed to have immigrated thence into Gujar&#257;t. The Dh&#363;sar Banias ascribe their name to a hill <a id="d0e3780"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3780">117</a>]</span>called Dh&#363;si or Dhosi on the border of Alwar State. The As&#257;tis say that their original home was T&#299;kamgarh State in Bundelkhand.
The name of the Maheshris is held to be derived from Maheshwar, an ancient town on the Nerbudda, near Indore, which is traditionally
supposed to have been the earliest settlement of the Y&#257;dava R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The headquarters of the Gahoi Banias is said to have
been at Kharagpur in Bundelkhand, though according to their own legend they are of mixed origin. The home of the Srim&#257;lis
was the old town of Srim&#257;l, now Bhinm&#257;l in M&#257;rw&#257;r. The Palliw&#257;l Banias were from the well-known trading town of P&#257;li in M&#257;rw&#257;r.
The Jaisw&#257;l are said to take their name from Jaisalmer State, which was their native country. The above are no doubt only
a fraction of the Bania subcastes, but they include nearly all the most important and representative ones, from whom the caste
takes its status and character. Of the numerous other groups the bulk have probably been brought into existence through the
migration and settlement of sections of the caste in different parts of the country, where they have become endogamous and
obtained a fresh name. Other subcastes may be composed of bodies of persons who, having taken to trade and prospered, obtained
admission to the Bania caste through the efforts of their Br&#257;hman priests. But a number of mixed groups of the same character
are also found among the Br&#257;hmans and R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and their existence does not invalidate arguments derived from a consideration
of the representative subcastes. It may be said that not only the Banias, but many of the low castes have legends showing
them to be of R&#257;jp&#363;t descent of the same character as those quoted above; and since in their case these stories have been
adjudged spurious and worthless, no greater importance should be attached to those of the Banias. But it must be remembered
that in the case of the Banias the stories are reinforced by the fact that the Bania subcastes certainly come from R&#257;jput&#257;na;
no doubt exists that they are of high caste, and that they must either be derived from Br&#257;hmans or R&#257;jp&#363;ts, or themselves
represent some separate foreign group; but if they are really the descendants of the Vaishyas, the main body of the Aryan
immigrants and the third of the four classical <a id="d0e3782"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3782">118</a>]</span>castes, it might be expected that their legends would show some trace of this instead of being unitedly in favour of their
R&#257;jp&#363;t origin.

</p>
<p>Colonel Tod gives a catalogue of the eighty-four mercantile tribes, whom he states to be chiefly of R&#257;jp&#363;t descent.<a id="d0e3786src" href="#d0e3786" class="noteref">5</a> In this list the Agarw&#257;l, Osw&#257;l, Srim&#257;l, Khandelw&#257;l, Palliw&#257;l and L&#257;d subcastes occur; while the Dh&#257;kar and Dh&#363;sar subcastes
may be represented by the names Dh&#257;karw&#257;l and Dusora in the lists. The other names given by Tod appear to be mainly small
territorial groups of R&#257;jput&#257;na. Elsewhere, after speaking of the claims of certain towns in R&#257;jput&#257;na to be centres of trade,
Colonel Tod remarks: &#8220;These pretensions we may the more readily admit, when we recollect that nine-tenths of the bankers and
commercial men of India are natives of M&#257;rudesh,<a id="d0e3791src" href="#d0e3791" class="noteref">6</a> and these chiefly of the Jain faith. The Osw&#257;ls, so termed from the town of Osi, near the Luni, estimate one hundred thousand
families whose occupation is commerce. All these claim a R&#257;jp&#363;t descent, a fact entirely unknown to the European inquirer
into the peculiarities of Hindu manners.&#8221;<a id="d0e3794src" href="#d0e3794" class="noteref">7</a>

</p>
<p>Similarly, Sir D. Ibbetson states that the Maheshri Banias claim R&#257;jp&#363;t origin and still have subdivisions bearing R&#257;jp&#363;t
names.<a id="d0e3801src" href="#d0e3801" class="noteref">8</a> Elliot also says that almost all the mercantile tribes of Hindust&#257;n are of R&#257;jp&#363;t descent.<a id="d0e3806src" href="#d0e3806" class="noteref">9</a>

</p>
<p>It would appear, then, that the Banias are an offshoot from the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, who took to commerce and learnt to read and write
for the purpose of keeping accounts. The Ch&#257;rans or bards are another literate caste derived from the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and it may
be noticed that both the Banias and Ch&#257;rans or Bh&#257;ts have hitherto been content with the knowledge of their own rude M&#257;rw&#257;ri
dialect and evinced no desire for classical learning or higher English education. Matters are now changing, but this attitude
shows that they have hitherto not desired education for itself but merely as an indispensable adjunct to their business.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3813">
<h3>7. Banias employed as ministers in R&#257;jp&#363;t courts.</h3>
<p>Being literate, the Banias were not infrequently employed <a id="d0e3818"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3818">119</a>]</span>as ministers and treasurers in R&#257;jp&#363;t states. Forbes says, in an account of an Indian court: &#8220;Beside the king stand the warriors
of R&#257;jp&#363;t race or, equally gallant in the field and wiser far in council, the W&#257;nia (Bania) Muntreshwars, already in profession
puritans of peace, and not yet drained enough of their fiery Kshatriya blood.... It is remarkable that so many of the officers
possessing high rank and holding independent commands are represented to have been W&#257;nias.&#8221;<a id="d0e3820src" href="#d0e3820" class="noteref">10</a> Colonel Tod writes that Nunkurn, the Kachhw&#257;ha chief of the Shekh&#257;wat federation, had a minister named Devi Das of the Bania
or mercantile caste, and, like thousands of that caste, energetic, shrewd and intelligent.<a id="d0e3825src" href="#d0e3825" class="noteref">11</a> Similarly, Muh&#257;j, the J&#257;don Bh&#257;tti chief of Jaisalmer, by an unhappy choice of a Bania minister, completed the demoralisation
of the Bh&#257;tti state. This minister was named Sar&#363;p Singh, a Bania of the Jain faith and Mehta family, whose descendants were
destined to be the exterminators of the laws and fortunes of the sons of Jaisal.<a id="d0e3830src" href="#d0e3830" class="noteref">12</a> Other instances of the employment of Bania ministers are to be found in R&#257;jp&#363;t history. Finally, it may be noted that the
Banias are by no means the only instance of a mercantile class formed from the R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The two important trading castes of
Khatri and Bh&#257;tia are almost certainly of R&#257;jp&#363;t origin, as is shown in the articles on those castes.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3835">
<h3>8. Subcastes.</h3>
<p>The Banias are divided into a large number of endogamous groups or subcastes, of which the most important have been treated
in the annexed subordinate articles. The minor subcastes, mainly formed by migration, vary greatly in different provinces.
Colonel Tod gave a list of eighty-four in R&#257;jput&#257;na, of which eight or ten only can be identified in the Central Provinces,
and of thirty mentioned by Bhattach&#257;rya as the most common groups in northern India, about a third are unknown in the Central
Provinces. The origin of such subcastes has already been explained. The main subcastes may be classified roughly into groups
coming from R&#257;jput&#257;na, Bundelkhand and the United Provinces. The leading R&#257;jput&#257;na groups are the Osw&#257;l, Maheshri, Khandelw&#257;l,
Saitw&#257;l, Srim&#257;l and Jaisw&#257;al. These groups are commonly <a id="d0e3840"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3840">120</a>]</span>known as M&#257;rw&#257;ri Bania or simply M&#257;rw&#257;ri. The Bundelkhand or Central India subcastes are the Gahoi, Golap&#363;rab, As&#257;ti, Umre
and Parw&#257;r;<a id="d0e3842src" href="#d0e3842" class="noteref">13</a> while the Agarw&#257;l, Dhusar, Agrahari, Ajudhiab&#257;si and others come from the United Provinces. The L&#257;d subcaste is from Gujar&#257;t,
while the Ling&#257;yats originally belonged to the Telugu and Canarese country. Several of the subcastes coming from the same
locality will take food cooked without water from each other, and occasionally two subcastes, as the Osw&#257;l and Khandelw&#257;l,
even food cooked with water or <i>katchi</i>. This practice is seldom found in other good castes. It is probably due to the fact that the rules about food are less strictly
observed in R&#257;jput&#257;na.

<div class="div2" id="d0e3852">
<h3>9. Hindu and Jain subcastes: divisions among subcastes.</h3>
<p>Another classification may be made of the subcastes according as they are of the Hindu or Jain religion; the important Jain
subcastes are the Osw&#257;l, Parw&#257;r, Golap&#363;rab, Saitw&#257;l and Charn&#257;gar, and one or two smaller ones, as the Baghelw&#257;l and Samaiya.
The other subcastes are principally Hindu, but many have a Jain minority, and similarly the Jain subcastes return a proportion
of Hindus. The difference of religion counts for very little, as practically all the non-Jain Banias are strict Vaishnava
Hindus, abstain entirely from any kind of flesh meat, and think it a sin to take animal life; while on their side the Jains
employ Br&#257;hmans for certain purposes, worship some of the local Hindu deities, and observe the principal Hindu festivals.
The Jain and Hindu sections of a subcaste have consequently, as a rule, no objection to taking food together, and will sometimes
intermarry. Several of the important subcastes are subdivided into B&#299;sa and Dasa, or twenty and ten groups. The B&#299;sa or twenty
group is of pure descent, or twenty carat, as it were, while the Dasas are considered to have a certain amount of alloy in
their family pedigree. They are the offspring of remarried widows, and perhaps occasionally of still more irregular unions.
Intermarriage sometimes takes place between the two groups, and families in the Dasa group, by living a respectable life and
marrying well, improve their status, and perhaps ultimately get back <a id="d0e3857"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3857">121</a>]</span>into the B&#299;sa group. As the Dasas become more respectable they will not admit to their communion newly remarried widows or
couples who have married within the prohibited degrees, or otherwise made a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, and hence a third inferior group, called the Pacha or five, is brought into existence to make room for these.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3862">
<h3>10. Exogamy and rules regulating marriage.</h3>
<p>Most subcastes have an elaborate system of exogamy. They are either divided into a large number of sections, or into a few
<i>gotras</i>, usually twelve, each of which is further split up into subsections. Marriage can then be regulated by forbidding a man to
take a wife from the whole of his own section or from the subsection of his mother, grandmothers and even greatgrandmothers.
By this means the union of persons within five or more degrees of relationship either through males or females is avoided,
and most Banias prohibit intermarriage, at any rate nominally, up to five degrees. Such practices as exchanging girls between
families or marrying two sisters are, as a rule, prohibited. The <i>gotras</i> or main sections appear to be frequently named after Br&#257;hman R&#299;shis or saints, while the subsections have names of a territorial
or titular character.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3873">
<h3>11. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>There is generally no recognised custom of paying a bride- or bridegroom-price, but one or two instances of its being done
are given in the subordinate articles. On the occasion of betrothal, among some subcastes, the boy&#8217;s father proceeds to the
girl&#8217;s house and presents her with a <i>m&#257;la</i> or necklace of gold or silver coins or coral, and a <i>mundri</i> or silver ring for the finger. The contract of betrothal is made at the village temple and the caste-fellows sprinkle turmeric
and water over the parties. Before the wedding the ceremony of Benaiki is performed; in this the bridegroom, riding on a horse,
and the bride on a decorated chair or litter, go round their villages and say farewell to their friends and relations. Sometimes
they have a procession in this way round the marriage-shed. Among the M&#257;rw&#257;ri Banias a <i>toran</i> or string of mango-leaves is stretched above the door of the house on the occasion of a wedding and left there for six months.
And a wooden triangle with figures perched on it to represent sparrows is tied over the door. The binding portion of the wedding
is the procession <a id="d0e3887"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3887">122</a>]</span>seven times round the marriage altar or post. In some Jain subcastes the bridegroom stands beside the post and the bride walks
seven times round him, while he throws sugar over her head at each turn. After the wedding the couple are made to draw figures
out of flour sprinkled on a brass plate in token of the bridegroom&#8217;s occupation of keeping accounts. It is customary for the
bride&#8217;s family to give <i>s&#299;dha</i> or uncooked food sufficient for a day&#8217;s consumption to every outsider who accompanies the marriage party, while to each member
of the caste provisions for two to five days are given. This is in addition to the evening feasts and involves great expense.
Sometimes the wedding lasts for eight days, and feasts are given for four days by the bridegroom&#8217;s party and four days by
the bride&#8217;s. It is said that in some places before a Bania has a wedding he goes before the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> and they ask him how many people he is going to invite. If he says five hundred, they prescribe the quantity of the different
kinds of provisions which he must supply. Thus they may say forty maunds (3200 lbs.) of sugar and flour, with butter, spices,
and other articles in proportion. He says, &#8216;Gentlemen, I am a poor man; make it a little less&#8217;; or he says he will give <i>gur</i> or cakes of raw cane sugar instead of refined sugar. Then they say, &#8216;No, your social position is too high for <i>gur</i>; you must have sugar for all purposes.&#8217; The more guests the host invites the higher is his social consideration; and it is
said that if he does not maintain this his life is not worth living. Sometimes the exact amount of entertainment to be given
at a wedding is fixed, and if a man cannot afford it at the time he must give the balance of the feasts at any subsequent
period when he has money; and if he fails to do this he is put out of caste. The bride&#8217;s father is often called on to furnish
a certain sum for the travelling expenses of the bridegroom&#8217;s party, and if he does not send this money they do not come.
The distinctive feature of a Bania wedding in the northern Districts is that women accompany the marriage procession, and
the Banias are the only high caste in which they do this. Hence a high-caste wedding party in which women are present can
be recognised to be a Bania&#8217;s. In the Mar&#257;tha <a id="d0e3901"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3901">123</a>]</span>Districts women also go, but here this custom obtains among other high castes. The bridegroom&#8217;s party hire or borrow a house
in the bride&#8217;s village, and here they erect a marriage-shed and go through the preliminary ceremonies of the wedding on the
bridegroom&#8217;s side as if they were at home.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3903">
<h3>12. Polygamy and widow-marriage.</h3>
<p>Polygamy is very rare among the Banias, and it is generally the rule that a man must obtain the consent of his first wife
before taking a second one. In the absence of this precaution for her happiness, parents will refuse to give him their daughter.
The remarriage of widows is nominally prohibited, but frequently occurs, and remarried widows are relegated to the inferior
social groups in each subcaste as already described. Divorce is also said to be prohibited, but it is probable that women
put away for adultery are allowed to take refuge in such groups instead of being finally expelled.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3908">
<h3>13. Disposal of the dead and mourning.</h3>
<p>The dead are cremated as a rule, and the ashes are thrown into a sacred river or any stream. The bodies of young children
and of persons dying from epidemic disease are buried. The period of mourning must be for an odd number of days. On the third
day a leaf plate with cooked food is placed on the ground where the body was burnt, and on some subsequent day a feast is
given to the caste. Rich Banias will hire people to mourn. Widows and young girls are usually employed, and these come and
sit before the house for an hour in the morning and sometimes also in the evening, and covering their heads with their cloths,
beat their breasts and make lamentations. Rich men may hire as many as ten mourners for a period of one, two or three months.
The M&#257;rw&#257;ris, when a girl is born, break an earthen pot to show that they have had a misfortune; but when a boy is born they
beat a brass plate in token of their joy.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3913">
<h3>14. Religion: the god Ganpati or Ganesh.</h3>
<p>Nearly all the Banias are Jains or Vaishnava Hindus. An account of the Jain religion has been given in a separate article,
and some notice of the retention of Hindu practices by the Jains is contained in the subordinate article on Parw&#257;r Bania.
The Vaishnava Banias no less than the Jains are strongly averse to the destruction of animal life, and will not kill any living
thing. Their principal deity is the god Ganesh <a id="d0e3918"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3918">124</a>]</span>or Ganpati, the son of Mah&#257;deo and P&#257;rvati, who is the god of good-luck, wealth and prosperity. Ganesh is represented in sculpture
with the head of an elephant and riding on a rat, though the rat is now covered by the body of the god and is scarcely visible.
He has a small body like a child&#8217;s with a fat belly and round plump arms. Perhaps his body signifies that he is figured as
a boy, the son of P&#257;rvati or Gauri. In former times grain was the main source of wealth, and from the appearance of Ganesh
it can be understood why he is the god of overflowing granaries, and hence of wealth and good fortune. The elephant is a sacred
animal among Hindus, and that on which the king rides. To have an elephant was a mark of wealth and distinction among Banias,
and the Jains harness the cars of their gods to elephants at their great <i>rath</i> or chariot festival. Gajpati or &#8216;lord of elephants&#8217; is a title given to a king; Gaj&#257;nand or &#8216;elephant-faced&#8217; is an epithet
of the god Ganesh and a favourite Hindu name. Gajv&#299;thi or the track of the elephant is a name of the Milky Way, and indicates
that there is believed to be a divine elephant who takes this course through the heavens. The elephant eats so much grain
that only a comparatively rich man can afford to keep one; and hence it is easy to understand how the attribute of plenty
or of wealth was associated with the divine elephant as his special characteristic. Similarly the rat is connected with overflowing
granaries, because when there is much corn in a Hindu house or store-shed there will be many rats; thus a multitude of rats
implied a rich household, and so this animal too came to be a symbol of wealth. The Hindus do not now consider the rat sacred,
but they have a tenderness for it, especially in the Mar&#257;tha country. The more bigoted of them objected to rats being poisoned
as a means of checking plague, though observation has fully convinced them that rats spread the plague; and in the Bania hospitals,
formerly maintained for preserving the lives of animals, a number of rats were usually to be found. The rat, in fact, may
now be said to stand to Ganpati in the position of a disreputable poor relation. No attempt is made to deny his existence,
but he is kept in the background as far as possible. The god Ganpati is also associated with wealth of grain through his <a id="d0e3923"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3923">125</a>]</span>parentage. He is the offspring of Siva or Mah&#257;deo and his wife Devi or Gauri. Mah&#257;deo is in this case probably taken in his
beneficent character of the deified bull; Devi in her most important aspect as the great mother-goddess is the earth, but
as mother of Ganesh she is probably imagined in her special form of Gauri, the yellow one, that is, the yellow corn. Gauri
is closely associated with Ganesh, and every Hindu bridal couple worship Gauri Ganesh together as an important rite of the
wedding. Their conjunction in this manner lends colour to the idea that they are held to be mother and son. In R&#257;jput&#257;na Gauri
is worshipped as the corn goddess at the Gangore festival about the time of the vernal equinox, especially by women. The meaning
of Gauri, Colonel Tod states, is yellow, emblematic of the ripened harvest, when the votaries of the goddess adore her effigies,
in the shape of a matron painted the colour of ripe corn. Here she is seen as Ana-p&#363;rna (the corn-goddess), the benefactress
of mankind. &#8220;The rites commence when the sun enters Aries (the opening of the Hindu year), by a deputation to a spot beyond
the city to bring earth for the image of Gauri. A small trench is then excavated in which barley is sown; the ground is irrigated
and artificial heat supplied till the grain germinates, when the females join hands and dance round it, invoking the blessings
of Gauri on their husbands. The young corn is then taken up, distributed and presented by the females to the men, who wear
it in their turbans.&#8221;<a id="d0e3925src" href="#d0e3925" class="noteref">14</a> Thus if Ganesh is the son of Gauri he is the offspring of the bull and the growing corn; and his genesis from the elephant
and the rat show him equally as the god of full granaries, and hence of wealth and good fortune. We can understand therefore
how he is the special god of the Banias, who formerly must have dealt almost entirely in grain, as coined money had not come
into general use.

<h3>15. Diw&#257;li festival.</h3>
<p>At the Diw&#257;li festival the Banias worship Ganpati or Ganesh, in conjunction with Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. Lakshmi is
considered to be the deified cow, and, as such, the other main source of wealth, both as mother of the bull, the tiller of
the soil, and the giver of milk from which <i>gh&#299;</i> <a id="d0e3938"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3938">126</a>]</span>(clarified butter) is made; this is another staple of the Bania&#8217;s trade, as well as a luxurious food, of which he is especially
fond. At Diw&#257;li all Banias make up their accounts for the year, and obtain the signatures of clients to their balances. They
open fresh account-books, which they first worship and adorn with an image of Ganesh, and perhaps an invocation to the god
on the front page. A silver rupee is also worshipped as an emblem of Lakshmi, but in some cases an English sovereign, as a
more precious coin, has been substituted, and this is placed on the seat of the goddess and reverence paid to it. The Banias
and Hindus generally think it requisite to gamble at Diw&#257;li in order to bring good luck during the coming year; all classes
indulge in a little speculation at this season.

<h3>16. Holi festival.</h3>
<p>In the month of Ph&#257;gun (February), about the time of the Holi, the M&#257;rw&#257;ris make an image of mud naked, calling it N&#257;thu R&#257;m,
who was supposed to be a great M&#257;rw&#257;ri. They mock at this and throw mud at it, and beat it with shoes, and have various jests
and sports. The men and women are divided into two parties, and throw dirty water and red powder over each other, and the
women make whips of cloth and beat the men. After two or three days, they break up the image and throw it away. The Banias,
both Jain and Hindu, like to begin the day by going and looking at the god in his temple. This is considered an auspicious
omen in the same manner as it is commonly held to be a good omen to see some particular person or class of person the first
thing in the morning. Others begin the day by worshipping the sacred <i>tulsi</i> or basil.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3952">
<h3>17. Social customs: rules about food.</h3>
<p>The Banias are very strict about food. The majority of them abstain from all kinds of flesh food and alcoholic liquor. The
Kasarw&#257;nis are reported to eat the flesh of clean animals, and perhaps others of the lower subcastes may also do so, but the
Banias are probably stricter than any other caste in their adherence to a vegetable diet. Many of them eschew also onions
and garlic as impure food. Banias take the lead in the objection to foreign sugar on account of the stories told of the impure
ingredients which it contains, and many of them, until recently, at any <a id="d0e3957"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3957">127</a>]</span>rate, still adhered to Indian sugar. Drugs are not forbidden, but they are not usually addicted to them. Tobacco is forbidden
to the Jains, but both they and the Hindus smoke, and their women sometimes chew tobacco. The Bania while he is poor is very
abstemious, and it is said that on a day when he has made no money he goes supperless to bed. But when he has accumulated
wealth, he develops a fondness for <i>gh&#299;</i> or preserved butter, which often causes him to become portly. Otherwise his food remains simple, and as a rule he confined
himself until recently to two daily meals, at midday and in the evening; but Banias, like most other classes who can afford
it, have now begun to drink tea in the morning. In dress the Bania is also simple, adhering to the orthodox Hindu garb of
a long white coat and a loin-cloth. He has not yet adopted the cotton trousers copied from the English fashion. Some Banias
in their shops wear only a cloth over their shoulders and another round their waist. The <i>kardora</i> or silver waist-belt is a favourite Bania ornament, and though plainly dressed in ordinary life, rich M&#257;rwa&#257;ris will on special
festival occasions wear costly jewels. On his head the M&#257;rw&#257;ri wears a small tightly folded turban, often coloured crimson,
pink or yellow; a green turban is a sign of mourning and also black, though the latter is seldom seen. The Banias object to
taking the life of any animal. They will not castrate cattle even through their servants, but sell the young bulls and buy
oxen. In Saugor, a Bania is put out of caste if he keeps buffaloes. It is supposed that good Hindus should not keep buffaloes
nor use them for carting or ploughing, because the buffalo is impure, and is the animal on which Yama, the god of death, rides.
Thus in his social observances generally the Bania is one of the strictest castes, and this is a reason why his social status
is high. Sometimes he is even held superior to the R&#257;jp&#363;t, as the local R&#257;jp&#363;ts are often of impure descent and lax in their
observance of religious and social restrictions. Though he soon learns the vernacular language of the country where he settles,
the M&#257;rw&#257;ri usually retains his own native dialect in his account-books, and this makes it more difficult for his customers
to understand them.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3970">
<h3>18. Character of the Bania.</h3>
<p>The Bania has a very distinctive caste character. From early boyhood he is trained to the keeping of accounts and to the view
that it is his business in life to make money, and that no transaction should be considered successful or creditable which
does not show a profit. As an apprentice, he goes through a severe training in mental arithmetic, so as to enable him to make
the most intricate calculations in his head. With this object a boy commits to memory a number of very elaborate tables. For
whole numbers he learns by heart the units from one to ten multiplied as high as forty times, and the numbers from eleven
to twenty multiplied to twenty times. There are also fractional tables, giving the results of multiplying &frac14;, &frac12;, &frac34;, 1&frac14;, 1&frac12;,
2&frac12;, 3&frac12; into units from one to one hundred; interest-tables showing the interest due on any sum from one to one thousand rupees
for one month, and for a quarter of a month at twelve per cent; tables of the squares of all numbers from one to one hundred,
and a set of technical rules for finding the price of a part from the price of the whole.<a id="d0e3975src" href="#d0e3975" class="noteref">15</a> The self-denial and tenacity which enable the Bania without capital to lay the foundations of a business are also remarkable.
On first settling in a new locality, a M&#257;rw&#257;ri Bania takes service with some shopkeeper, and by dint of the strictest economy
puts together a little money. Then the new trader establishes himself in some village and begins to make grain advances to
the cultivators on high rates of interest, though occasionally on bad security. He opens a shop and retails grain, pulses,
condiments, spices, sugar and flour. From grain he gradually passes to selling cloth and lending money, and being keen and
exacting, and having to deal with ignorant and illiterate clients, he acquires wealth; this he invests in purchasing villages,
and after a time blossoms out into a big Seth or banker. The Bania can also start a retail business without capital. The way
in which he does it is to buy a rupee&#8217;s worth of stock in a town, and take it out early in the morning to a village, where
he sits on the steps of the temple until he has sold it. Up till then he neither eats nor washes his face. He comes back in
the evening after <a id="d0e3980"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3980">129</a>]</span>having eaten two or three pice worth of grain, and buys a fresh stock, which he takes out to another village in the morning.
Thus he turns over his capital with a profit two or three times a week according to the saying, &#8220;If a Bania gets a rupee he
will have an income of eight rupees a month,&#8221; or as another proverb pithily sums up the immigrant M&#257;rw&#257;ri&#8217;s career, &#8216;He comes
with a <i>lota</i><a id="d0e3984src" href="#d0e3984" class="noteref">16</a> and goes back with a lakh.&#8217; The Bania never writes off debts, even though his debtor may be a pauper, but goes on entering
them up year by year in his account-books and taking the debtor&#8217;s acknowledgment. For he says, &#8216;<i lang="und">Purus P&#257;rus</i>&#8217;, or man is like the philosopher&#8217;s stone, and his fortune may change any day.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e3990">
<h3>19. Dislike of the cultivators towards him.</h3>
<p>The cultivators rarely get fair treatment from the Banias, as the odds are too much against them. They must have money to
sow their land, and live while the crops are growing, and the majority who have no capital are at the moneylender&#8217;s mercy.
He is of a different caste, and often of a different country, and has no fellow-feeling towards them, and therefore considers
the transaction merely from the business point of view of getting as much profit as possible. The debtors are illiterate,
often not even understanding the meaning of figures, or the result of paying compound interest at twenty-five or fifty per
cent; they can neither keep accounts themselves nor check their creditor&#8217;s. Hence they are entirely in his hands, and in the
end their villages or land, if saleable, pass to him, and they decline from landlord to tenant, or from tenant to labourer.
They have found vent for their feelings in some of the bitterest sayings ever current: &#8216;A man who has a Bania for a friend
has no need of an enemy.&#8217; &#8216;Borrow from a Bania and you are as good as ruined.&#8217; &#8216;The rogue cheats strangers and the Bania cheats
his friends.&#8217; &#8216;Kick a Bania even if he is dead.&#8217; &#8220;His heart, we are told, is no bigger than a coriander seed; he goes in like
a needle and comes out like a sword; as a neighbour he is as bad as a boil in the armpit. If a Bania is on the other side
of a river you should leave your bundle on this side for fear he should steal it. If a Bania is drowning you should not give
him your hand; he is sure to have some pecuniary motive for drifting down-stream. <a id="d0e3995"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3995">130</a>]</span>A Bania will start an auction in a desert. If a Bania&#8217;s son tumbles down he is sure to pick up something. He uses light weights
and swears that the scales tip up of themselves; he keeps his accounts in a character that no one but God can read; if you
borrow from him your debt mounts up like a refuse-heap or gallops like a horse; if he talks to a customer he debits the conversation
in his accounts; and when his own credit is shaky he writes up his transactions on the wall so that they can easily be rubbed
out.&#8221;<a id="d0e3997src" href="#d0e3997" class="noteref">17</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4003">
<h3>20. His virtues.</h3>
<p>Nevertheless there is a good deal to be said on the other side, and the Bania&#8217;s faults are probably to a large extent produced
by his environment, like other people&#8217;s. One of the Bania&#8217;s virtues is that he will lend on security which neither the Government
nor the banks would look at, or on none at all. Then he will always wait a long time for his money, especially if the interest
is paid. No doubt this is no loss to him, as he keeps his money out at good interest; but it is a great convenience to a client
that his debt can be postponed in a bad year, and that he can pay as much as he likes in a good one. The village moneylender
is indispensable to its economy when the tenants are like school-boys in that money burns a hole in their pocket; and Sir
Denzil Ibbetson states that it is surprising how much reasonableness and honesty there is in his dealings with the people,
so long as he can keep his transactions out of a court of justice.<a id="d0e4008src" href="#d0e4008" class="noteref">18</a> Similarly, Sir Reginald Craddock writes: &#8220;The village Bania is a much-abused individual, but he is as a rule a quiet, peaceable
man, a necessary factor in the village economy. He is generally most forbearing with his clients and customers, and is not
the person most responsible for the indebtedness of the ryot. It is the casual moneylender with little or no capital who lives
by his wits, or the large firms with shops and agents scattered over the face of the country who work the serious mischief.
These latter encourage the people to take loans and discourage repayment until the debt has increased by accumulation of interest
to a sum from which the borrower cannot easily free himself.&#8221;<a id="d0e4013src" href="#d0e4013" class="noteref">19</a>
<a id="d0e4018"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4018">131</a>]</span>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4020">
<h3>21. The moneylender changed for the worse.</h3>
<p>The progress of administration, bringing with it easy and safe transit all over the country; the institution of a complete
system of civil justice and the stringent enforcement of contracts through the courts; the introduction of cash coinage as
the basis of all transactions; and the grant of proprietary and transferable rights in land, appear to have at the same time
enhanced the Bania&#8217;s prosperity and increased the harshness and rapacity of his dealings. When the moneylender lived in the
village he had an interest in the solvency of the tenants who constituted his client&egrave;le and was also amenable to public opinion,
even though not of his own caste. For it would clearly be an impossibly unpleasant position for him to meet no one but bitter
enemies whenever he set foot outside his house, and to go to bed in nightly fear of being dacoited and murdered by a combination
of his next-door neighbours. He therefore probably adopted the motto of live and let live, and conducted his transactions
on a basis of custom, like the other traders and artisans who lived among the village community. But with the rise of the
large banking-houses whose dealings are conducted through agents over considerable tracts of country, public opinion can no
longer act. The agent looks mainly to his principal, and the latter has no interest in or regard for the cultivators of distant
villages. He cares only for his profit, and his business is conducted with a single view to that end. He himself has no public
opinion to face, as he lives in a town among a community of his caste-fellows, and here absolutely no discredit is attached
to grinding the faces of the poor, but on the contrary the honour and consideration accruing to him are in direct proportion
to his wealth. The agent may have some compunction, but his first aim is to please his principal, and as he is often a sojourner
liable to early transfer he cares little what may be said or thought about him locally.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4025">
<h3>22. The enforcement of contracts.</h3>
<p>Again the introduction of the English law of contract and transfer of property, and the increase in the habit of litigation
have greatly altered the character of the money-lending business for the worse. The debtor signs a bond sometimes not even
knowing the conditions, more often having heard them but without any clear idea of their effect <a id="d0e4030"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4030">132</a>]</span>or of the consequences to himself, and as readily allows it to be registered. When it comes into court the witnesses, who
are the moneylender&#8217;s creatures, easily prove that it was a genuine and <i>bona fide</i> transaction, and the debtor is too ignorant and stupid to be able to show that he did not understand the bargain or that
it was unconscionable. In any case the court has little or no power to go behind a properly executed contract without any
actual evidence of fraud, and has no option but to decree it in terms of the deed. This evil is likely to be remedied very
shortly, as the Government of India have announced a proposal to introduce the recent English Act and allow the courts the
discretion to go behind contracts, and to refuse to decree exorbitant interest or other hard bargains. This urgently needed
reform will, it may be hoped, greatly improve the character of the civil administration by encouraging the courts to realise
that it is their business to do justice between litigants, and not merely to administer the letter of the law; and at the
same time it should have the result, as in England, of quickening the public conscience and that of the moneylenders themselves,
which has indeed already been to some extent awakened by other Government measures, including the example set by the Government
itself as a creditor.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4035">
<h3>23. Cash coinage and the rate of interest.</h3>
<p>Again the free circulation of metal currency and its adoption as a medium for all transactions has hitherto been to the disadvantage
of the debtors. Interest on money was probably little in vogue among pastoral peoples, and was looked upon with disfavour,
being prohibited by both the Mosaic and Muhammadan codes. The reason was perhaps that in a pastoral community there existed
no means of making a profit on a loan by which interest could be paid, and hence the result of usury was that the debtor ultimately
became enslaved to his creditor; and the enslavement of freemen on any considerable scale was against the public interest.
With the introduction of agriculture a system of loans on interest became a necessary and useful part of the public economy,
as a cultivator could borrow grain to sow land and support himself and his family until the crop ripened, out of which the
loan, principal and interest, could be repaid. If, as seems likely, this was the first occasion <a id="d0e4040"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4040">133</a>]</span>for the introduction of the system of loan-giving on a large scale, it would follow that the rate of interest would be based
largely on the return yielded by the earth to the seed. Support is afforded to this conjecture by the fact that in the case
of grain loans in the Central Provinces the interest on loans of grain of the crops which yield a comparatively small return,
such as wheat, is twenty-five to fifty per cent, while in the case of those which yield a large return, such as ju&#257;ri and
kodon, it is one hundred per cent. These high rates of interest were not of much importance so long as the transaction was
in grain. The grain was much less valuable at harvest than at seed time, and in addition the lender had the expense of storing
and protecting his stock of grain through the year. It is probable that a rate of twenty-five per cent on grain loans does
not yield more than a reasonable profit to the lender. But when in recent times cash came to be substituted for grain it would
appear that there was no proportionate reduction in the interest. The borrower would lose by having to sell his grain for
the payment of his debt at the most unfavourable rate after harvest, and since the transaction was by a regular deed the lender
no longer took any share of the risk of a bad harvest, as it is probable that he was formerly accustomed to do. The rates
of interest for cash loans afforded a disproportionate profit to the lender, who was put to no substantial expense in keeping
money as he had formerly been in the case of grain. It is thus probable that rates for cash loans were for a considerable
period unduly severe in proportion to the risk, and involved unmerited loss to the borrower. This is now being remedied by
competition, by Government loans given on a large scale in time of scarcity, and by the introduction of co-operative credit.
But it has probably contributed to expedite the transfer of land from the cultivating to the moneylending classes.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4042">
<h3>24. Proprietary and transferable rights in land.</h3>
<p>Lastly the grant of proprietary and transferable right to land has afforded a new incentive and reward to the successful moneylender.
Prior to this measure it is probable that no considerable transfers of land occurred for ordinary debt. The village headman
might be ousted for non-payment of revenue, or simply through the greed of some Government <a id="d0e4047"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4047">134</a>]</span>official under native rule, and of course the villages were continually pillaged and plundered by their own and hostile armies
such as the Pind&#257;ris, while the population was periodically decimated by famine. But apart from their losses by famine, war
and the badness of the central government, it is probable that the cultivators were held to have a hereditary right to their
land, and were not liable to ejectment on the suit of any private person. It is doubtful whether they had any conception of
ownership of the land, and it seems likely that they may have thought of it as a god or the property of the god; but the cultivating
castes perhaps had a hereditary right to cultivate it, just as the Cham&#257;r had a prescriptive right to the hides of the village
cattle, the Kal&#257;r to the mahua-flowers for making his liquor, the Kumh&#257;r to clay for his pots, and the Teli to press the oil-seeds
grown in his village. The inferior castes were not allowed to hold land, and it was probably never imagined that the village
moneylender should by means of a piece of stamped paper be able to oust the cultivators indebted to him and take their land
himself. With the grant of proprietary right to land such as existed in England, and the application of the English law of
contract and transfer of property, a new and easy road to wealth was opened to the moneylender, of which he was not slow to
take advantage. The Banias have thus ousted numbers of improvident proprietors of the cultivating castes, and many of them
have become large landlords. A considerable degree of protection has now been afforded to landowners and cultivators, and
the process has been checked, but that it should have proceeded so far is regrettable; and the operation of the law has been
responsible for a large amount of unintentional injustice to the cultivating castes and especially to proprietors of aboriginal
descent, who on account of their extreme ignorance and improvidence most readily fall a prey to the moneylender.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4049">
<h3>25. The Bania as a landlord.</h3>
<p>As landlords the Banias were not at first a success. They did not care to spend money in improving their property, and ground
their tenants to the utmost. Sir R. Craddock remarks of them:<a id="d0e4054src" href="#d0e4054" class="noteref">20</a> &#8220;Great or small they are absolutely unfitted by their natural instincts to be landlords. <a id="d0e4059"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4059">135</a>]</span>Shrewdest of traders, most business-like in the matter of bargains, they are unable to take a broad view of the duties of
landlord or to see that rack-renting will not pay in the long run.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Still, under the influence of education, and the growth of moral feeling, as well as the desire to stand well with Government
officers and to obtain recognition in the shape of some honour, many of the M&#257;rw&#257;ri proprietors are developing into just and
progressive landlords. But from the cultivator&#8217;s point of view, residence on their estates, which are managed by agents in
charge of a number of villages for an absent owner, cannot compare with the system of the small cultivating proprietor resident
among tenants of his own caste, and bound to them by ties of sympathy and caste feeling, which produces, as described by Sir
R. Craddock, the ideal village.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4063">
<h3>26. Commercial honesty.</h3>
<p>As a trader the Bania formerly had a high standard of commercial probity. Even though he might show little kindliness or honesty
in dealing with the poorer class of borrowers, he was respected and absolutely reliable in regard to money. It was not unusual
for people to place their money in a rich Bania&#8217;s hands without interest, even paying him a small sum for safe-keeping. Bankruptcy
was considered disgraceful, and was visited with social penalties little less severe than those enforced for breaches of caste
rules. There was a firm belief that a merchant&#8217;s condition in the next world depended on the discharge of all claims against
him. And the duty of paying ancestral debts was evaded only in the case of helpless or hopeless poverty. Of late, partly owing
to the waning power of caste and religious feeling in the matter, and partly to the knowledge of the bankruptcy laws, the
standard of commercial honour has greatly fallen. Since the case of bankruptcy is governed and arranged for by law, the trader
thinks that so long as he can keep within the law he has done nothing wrong. A banker, when heavily involved, seldom scruples
to become a bankrupt and to keep back money enough to enable him to start afresh, even if he does nothing worse. This, however,
is probably a transitory phase, and the same thing has happened in England and America at one stage of commercial development.
In time it may be expected that the loss of the old <a id="d0e4068"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4068">136</a>]</span>religious and caste feeling will be made good by a new standard of commercial honour enforced by public opinion among merchants
generally. The Banias are very good to their own caste, and when a man is ruined will have a general subscription and provide
funds to enable him to start afresh in a small way. Beggars are very rare in the caste. Rich M&#257;rw&#257;ris are extremely generous
in their subscriptions to objects of public utility, but it is said that the small Bania is not very charitably inclined,
though he doles out handfuls of grain to beggars with fair liberality. But he has a system by which he exacts from those who
deal with him a slight percentage on the price received by them for religious purposes. This is called Deod&#257;n or a gift to
God, and is supposed to go into some public fund for the construction or maintenance of a temple or similar object. In the
absence of proper supervision or audit it is to be feared that the Bania inclines to make use of it for his private charity,
thus saving himself expense on that score. The system has been investigated by Mr. Napier, Commissioner of Jubbulpore, with
a view to the application of these funds to public improvements.

</span><h2>Bania, Agarw&#257;la</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Agarw&#257;la, Agarw&#257;l.</b>&#8212;This is generally considered to be the highest and most important subdivision of the Banias. They numbered about 25,000 persons
in the Central Provinces in 1911, being principally found in Jubbulpore and N&#257;gpur. The name is probably derived from Agroha,
a small town in the Hiss&#257;r District of the Punjab, which was formerly of some commercial importance. Buchanan records that
when any firm failed in the city each of the others contributed a brick and five rupees, which formed a stock sufficient for
the merchant to recommence trade with advantage. The Agarw&#257;las trace their descent from a R&#257;ja Agar Sen, whose seventeen sons
married the seventeen daughters of B&#257;suki, the king of the N&#257;gas or snakes. Elliot considers that the snakes were really the
Scythian or barbarian immigrants, the Yueh-chi or Kush&#257;ns, from whom several of the R&#257;jp&#257;t clans as the T&#257;k, Haih&#257;yas and
others, who also have the legend of snake ancestry, were probably derived. Elliot also remarks that R&#257;ja Agar Sen, being a
<a id="d0e4077"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4077">137</a>]</span>king, must have been a Kshatriya, and thus according to the legend the Agarw&#257;las would have R&#257;jp&#363;t ancestry on both sides.
Their appearance, Mr. Crooke states, indicates good race and breeding, and would lend colour to the theory of a R&#257;jp&#363;t origin.
R&#257;ja Agar Sen is said to have ruled over both Agra and Agroha, and it seems possible that the name of the Agarw&#257;las may also
be connected with Agra, which is a much more important place than Agroha. The country round Agra and Delhi is their home,
and the shrine of the tutelary goddess of some of the Agarw&#257;las in the Central Provinces is near Delhi. The memory of the
N&#257;ga princess who was their ancestor is still, Sir H. Risley states, held in honour by the Agarw&#257;las, and they say, &#8216;Our mother&#8217;s
house is of the race of the snake.&#8217;<a id="d0e4079src" href="#d0e4079" class="noteref">1</a> No Agarw&#257;la, whether Hindu or Jain, will kill or molest a snake, and the Vaishnava Agarw&#257;las of Delhi paint pictures of snakes
on either side of the outside doors of their houses, and make offerings of fruit and flowers before them.

</p>
<p>In the Central Provinces, like other Bania subcastes, they are divided into the B&#299;sa and Dasa or twenty and ten subdivisions,
which marry among themselves. The B&#299;sa rank higher than the Dasa, the latter being considered to have some flaw in their pedigree,
such as descent from a remarried widow. The Dasas are sometimes said to be the descendants of the maidservants who accompanied
the seventeen N&#257;ga or snake princesses on their marriages to the sons of R&#257;ja Agar Sen. A third division has now come into
existence in the Central Provinces, known as the Pacha or fives; these are apparently of still more doubtful origin than the
Dasas. The divisions tend to be endogamous, but if a man of the B&#299;sa or Dasa cannot obtain a wife from his own group he will
sometimes marry in a lower group.

</p>
<p>The Agarw&#257;las are divided into seventeen and a half <i>gotras</i> or exogamous sections, which are supposed to be descended from the seventeen sons of R&#257;ja Agar Sen. The extra half <i>gotra</i> is accounted for by a legend, but it probably has in reality also something to do with illegitimate descent. Some of the
<i>gotras</i>, as given by Mr. Crooke, are as a matter of fact named after Br&#257;hmanical saints like those of the <a id="d0e4097"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4097">138</a>]</span>Br&#257;hmans; instances of these are Garga, Gautama, Kaushika, Kasyapa and Vasishtha; the others appear to be territorial or titular
names. The prohibitions on marriage between relations are far-reaching among the Agarw&#257;las. The detailed rules are given in
the article on Bania, and the effect is that persons descended from a common ancestor cannot intermarry for five generations.
When the wedding procession is about to start the Kumh&#257;r brings his donkey and the bridegroom has to touch it with his foot,
or, according to one version, ride upon it. The origin of this custom is obscure, but the people now say that it is meant
to emphasise the fact that the bridegroom is going to do a foolish thing. The remarriage of widows is prohibited, and divorce
is not recognised. Most of the Agarw&#257;las are Vaishnava by religion, but a few are Jains. Intermarriage between members of
the two religions is permitted in some localities, and the wife adopts that of her husband. The Jain Agarw&#257;las observe the
Hindu festivals and employ Br&#257;hmans for their ceremonies. In Nim&#257;r the caste have some curious taboos. It is said that a married
woman may not eat wheat until a child has been born to her, but only ju&#257;ri; and if she has no child she may not eat wheat
all her life. If a son is born to her she must go to Mahaur, a village near Delhi where the tutelary goddess of the caste
has her shrine. This goddess is called Mohna Devi, and she is the deified spirit of a woman who burnt herself with her husband.
After this the woman may eat wheat; but if a second son is born she must stop eating wheat until she has been to the shrine
again. But if she has a daughter she may at once and always eat wheat without visiting the shrine. These rules, as well as
the veneration of a snake, from which they believe themselves to be descended on the mother&#8217;s side, may perhaps, as suggested
by Sir H. Risley, be a relic of the system of matriarchal descent. It is said that when R&#257;ja Agar Sen or his sons married
the N&#257;ga princesses, he obtained permission as a special favour from the goddess Lakshmi that the children should bear their
father&#8217;s name and not their mother&#8217;s.<a id="d0e4099src" href="#d0e4099" class="noteref">2</a>

</p>
<p>In Nim&#257;r some Agarw&#257;las worship Goba P&#299;r, the god of <a id="d0e4106"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4106">139</a>]</span>the sweepers. He is represented by a pole some 30 feet long on which are hung a cloth and cocoanuts. The sweepers carry this
through the city almost daily during the month of Shr&#257;wan (July), and people offer cocoanuts, tying them on to the pole. Some
Agarw&#257;las offer vermilion to the god in token of worship, and a few invite it to the compounds of their houses and keep it
there all night for the same purpose. When a feast is given in the caste the Agarw&#257;las do not take their own brass vessels
according to the usual practice, but the host gives them little earthen pots to drink from which are afterwards broken, and
leaf-plates for their food. The Agarw&#257;las will take food cooked without water (<i>pakki</i>) from Osw&#257;l, Maheshri and Khandelw&#257;l Banias. The Agarw&#257;las of the Central Provinces hold some substantial estates in Chhatt&#299;sgarh;
these were obtained at the first settlements during 1860&#8211;70, when considerable depression existed, and many of the village
headmen were unwilling to accept the revenue assessed on their villages. The more enterprising Banias stepped in and took
them, and have profited enormously owing to the increase in the value of land. Akbar&#8217;s great minister, Todar Mal, who first
introduced an assessment of the land-revenue based on the measurement and survey of the land, is said to have been an Agarw&#257;la.

<p><b>Bania, Agrahari.</b><a id="d0e4117src" href="#d0e4117" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;This subcaste numbered nearly 2000 persons in 1911, resident principally in Jubbulpore, Raipur and Bil&#257;spur, and some of
the Feudatory States. Mr. Crooke states that they claim partly a Vaishya and partly a Br&#257;hmanical descent, and wear the sacred
thread. Like that of the Agarw&#257;la Banias their name has been connected with the cities of Agra and Agroha. There is no doubt
that they are closely connected with the Agarw&#257;las, and Mr. Nesfield suggests that the two groups must have been sections
of one and the same caste which quarrelled on some trifling matter connected with cooking or eating, and have remained separate
ever since. The Agrahari Banias are Hindus, and some of them belong to <a id="d0e4123"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4123">140</a>]</span>the N&#257;nakpanthi sect. They are principally dealers in provisions, and they have acquired some discredit as compared with their
kinsfolk the Agarw&#257;las, through not secluding their women and allowing them to attend the shop. They also retail various sweet-smelling
woods which are used in religious ceremonies, such as aloe-wood and sandalwood, besides a number of medicines and simples.
The richer members of the caste are bankers, dealers in grain and pawnbrokers.

</span><h2>Bania, Ajudhiab&#257;si</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Ajudhiab&#257;si, Audhia</b>.&#8212;A subcaste of Bania, whose name signifies a resident of Ajodhia, the old name of Oudh. Outsiders often shorten the name
to Audhia, but, as will be seen, the name Audhia is regularly applied to a criminal class, who may have been derived from
the Ajudhiab&#257;si Banias, but are now quite distinct from them. The Ajudhiab&#257;sis numbered nearly 2000 persons in 1911, belonging
chiefly to the Jubbulpore, Narsinghpur and Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d Districts. This total includes any persons who may have returned themselves
as Audhia. The Ajudhiab&#257;sis are nearly all Hindus with a small Jain minority. Though Oudh was their original home they are
now fairly numerous in Cawnpore and Bundelkhand as well, and it may have been from this last locality that they entered the
Central Provinces. Here they form a separate endogamous group and do not marry with their caste-fellows in northern India.
They have exogamous sections, and marriage is prohibited within the section and also between first cousins. They permit the
remarriage of widows, but are said not to recognise divorce, and to expel from the caste a woman guilty of adultery. It may
be doubted, however, whether this is correct. Br&#257;hmans serve as their priests, and they invest boys with the sacred thread
either at marriage or at a special ceremony known as Gurmukh. The dead are either buried or burnt; in the case of burial men
are laid on the face and women on the back, the body being first rubbed with salt, clarified butter, turmeric and milk. A
little earth from the grave is carried away and thrown into a sacred river, and when the dead are burnt the ashes are similarly
disposed of. <a id="d0e4132"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4132">141</a>]</span>Their principal deity is the goddess Devi, and at the Dasahra festival they offer a goat to her, the flesh of which is distributed
among members of the caste.

</p>
<p>The Audhias are a well-known criminal tribe, whose headquarters is in the Fatehpur District. They say that they are Banias,
and use the name Ajudhiab&#257;si in speaking of themselves, and from their customs and criminal methods it seems not unlikely
that they may originally have been an offshoot from the Ajudhiab&#257;si Banias. They are now, however, perfectly distinct from
this group, and any confusion between them would be very unjust to the latter. In northern India it is said that the Audhias
deal largely in counterfeit coin and false jewellery, and never commit crimes of violence;<a id="d0e4136src" href="#d0e4136" class="noteref">1</a> but in Bombay they have taken to housebreaking, though they usually select an empty house.<a id="d0e4142src" href="#d0e4142" class="noteref">2</a> From their homes in the United Provinces they wander over Central India, the Central Provinces, Bengal and Bombay; they are
said to avoid the Punjab and Sind owing to difficulties of working, and they have made it a caste offence to commit any crime
in the Ganges-Jumna Do&#257;b, probably because this is their home. It is said also that if any one of them is imprisoned he is
put out of caste. They wander about disguised as religious mendicants, Br&#257;hmans or Bair&#257;gis. They carry their bedding tied
on their back with a cloth, and a large bag slung over the shoulders which contains food, cooking-vessels and other articles.
Sometimes they pretend to be Banias and hawk about sweets and groceries, or one of the gang opens a shop, which serves as
a rendezvous and centre for collecting information.<a id="d0e4148src" href="#d0e4148" class="noteref">3</a> In the Districts where they reside they are perfectly well-behaved. They are well-to-do and to all appearance respectable
in their habits. Their women are well-dressed with plenty of ornaments on their persons. They have no apparent means of support;
they neither cultivate land nor trade; and all that appears on the surface is that most of the men and boys go off after the
rains and return at the end of <a id="d0e4153"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4153">142</a>]</span>the cold weather. If asked how they support themselves they reply by begging. Their marriage rules are those of high-caste
Hindus. They are divided into two classes, Unch or high and N&#299;ch or low, the former being of pure blood, and the latter the
descendants of kept women. These are practically endogamous. A man may not have more than two wives. If a girl is detected
in immorality before marriage, she is permanently excommunicated, and a married woman can be turned out by her husband on
proof of adultery. A bridegroom-price is usually paid, the father of the bride visiting the bridegroom and giving him the
money in secret. The dead are burnt, and Br&#257;hmans are duly fed. If a man has died through an accident or from cholera, smallpox,
poison or leprosy, the corpse, if available, is at once consigned to the Ganges or other river, and during the course of the
next twelve months a Mah&#257;br&#257;hman is paid to make an image of the deceased in gram-flour, which is cremated with the usual
rites. As in the case of the Ajudhiab&#257;si Banias, the tribal deity of the Audhias is the goddess Devi.<a id="d0e4155src" href="#d0e4155" class="noteref">4</a>

They say that their original home was the T&#299;kamgarh State in Bundelkhand. They do not rank very high, and are sometimes said
to be the descendants of an Ah&#299;r who became a Bania. The great bulk are Hindus and a small minority Jains. It is told of the

</span><h2>Bania, Charn&#257;gri</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Charn&#257;gri, Chann&#257;gri, Samaiya.</b>&#8212;The Charn&#257;gris are a small Jain subcaste which numbered about 2500 <a id="d0e4182"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4182">143</a>]</span>persons in 1911, residing principally in the Damoh and Chh&#299;ndw&#257;ra Districts. They are the followers of one Taran Sw&#257;mi, who
is said to have lived about five centuries ago. He preached against the worship of the images of the Jain Tirthak&#257;rs, and
said that this should be abandoned and only the sacred books be revered. The chief sacred place of the sect is Malh&#257;rgarh
in Gwalior State; here the tomb of their prophet is situated and there is also a large temple in which the Jain scriptures
are enshrined. In the month of Ph&#257;gun (February) a fair is held here, and Charn&#257;gris dance in the temples, holding lighted
lamps in their hands. Nowadays the Charn&#257;gris also visit the ordinary Jain temples when their own are not available. They
are practically all derived from Parw&#257;r Banias, and formerly would sometimes give their daughters to Parw&#257;rs in marriage,
but this practice is said to have stopped. Like other Bania subcastes, they are divided into B&#299;sa and Dasa, or twenty and
ten sections, the Dasa being of irregular descent. Intermarriage between the two sections occasionally occurs, and the Dasa
will take food from the B&#299;sa section, but the latter do not reciprocate except at caste feasts.

</span><h2>Bania, Dh&#363;sar</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Dh&#363;sar, Bh&#257;rgava Dh&#363;sar.</b>&#8212;The origin of this group is much disputed. They are usually classed as a subcaste of Bania, but claim to be Br&#257;hmans. They
take their name from a hill called Dh&#363;si or Dhosi, near Narnaul on the border of Alwar State. The title Bh&#257;rgava signifies
a descendant of Bhrigu, one of the famous eponymous R&#299;shis or Br&#257;hmanical saints, to whom Manu confided his institutes, calling
him his son. If this was their original name, it would show that they were Br&#257;hmans, but its adoption appears to be somewhat
recent. Their claim to be Br&#257;hmans is, however, admitted by many members of that caste, and it is stated that they perform
the functions of Br&#257;hmans in their original home in R&#257;jput&#257;na. Mr. Burn wrote of them:<a id="d0e4191src" href="#d0e4191" class="noteref">1</a> &#8220;In his book on castes published in 1872 Mr. Sherring does not refer to any claim to kinship with Br&#257;hmans, though in his
description of Dh&#363;sar Banias he appears to include the people under consideration. Both <a id="d0e4196"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4196">144</a>]</span>the Dh&#363;sar Bh&#257;rgavas and Dh&#363;sar Banias assert that Himu, the capable Vaz&#299;r of Muhammad Sh&#257;h Suri, belonged to their community,
and such a claim by the former is if anything in favour of the view that they are not Br&#257;hmans, since Himu is variously described
by Muhammadan writers as a corn-chandler, a weighman and a Bania. Colonel Dow in his history of Hindust&#257;n calls him a shopkeeper
who was raised by Sher Sh&#257;h to be Superintendent of Markets. It is not improbable that Himu&#8217;s success laid the foundation
for a claim to a higher position, but the matter does not admit of absolute proof, and I have therefore accepted the decision
of the majority of the caste-committees and considered them as a caste allied to Br&#257;hmans.&#8221; In the Punjab the Dh&#363;sars appear
to be in some places Br&#257;hmans and in others Banias. &#8220;They take their food before morning prayer, contrary to the Hindu rule,
but of late years they have begun to conform to the orthodox practice. The Br&#257;hman Dh&#363;sar marries with his caste-fellows and
the Bania with Banias, avoiding always the same family (<i>gotra</i>) or one having the same family deity.&#8221;<a id="d0e4201src" href="#d0e4201" class="noteref">2</a> From the above accounts it would appear that the Dh&#363;sars may have originally been a class of Br&#257;hmans who took to trade,
like the Palliw&#257;l Br&#257;hmans of M&#257;rw&#257;r, and have lost their position as Br&#257;hmans and become amalgamated with the Bania caste;
or they may have been Banias, who acted as priests to others of the community, and hence claimed to be Br&#257;hmans. The caste
is important and influential, and is now making every effort to recover or substantiate its Br&#257;hman status. One writer states
that they combine the office aptitude and hard-heartedness to a debtor characteristic of the Bania. The Dh&#363;sars are rigid

</span><h2>Bania, Dosar</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Dosar, D&#363;sra.</b><a id="d0e4221src" href="#d0e4221" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;This subcaste numbers about 600 persons. The original name is D&#363;sra or second, and the Dosar or D&#363;sra are a section of the
Ummar Banias, who were so called because they permit widows to make a second marriage. Their home is the Ganges-Jumna Do&#257;b
and Oudh, and in the United Provinces they are classed as an inferior subcaste of the Ummars. Here they say that the Ummars
are their elder brothers. In the Central Provinces they are said to be forming three local endogamous groups according as
their homes were in the Doab, Oudh or the Allah&#257;b&#257;d country; and members of each of these marry among themselves. The Dosars
say that they all belong to the Kashyap<a id="d0e4224src" href="#d0e4224" class="noteref">2</a> <i>gotra</i> or clan, but for the purpose of marriage they have territorial or titular exogamous sections; instances of these are Gangap&#257;ri,
a native of Oudh; S&#257;garah, a resident of Saugor; Makraha, a seller of <i>makka</i> or maize, and Tam&#257;khuha, a tobacco-seller. They pay a bridegroom-price, the full recognised amount of which is Rs. 211, either
in cash or brass cooking-vessels. Those who cannot afford this sum give half of it or Rs. 105, and the poorest classes pay
anything they can afford. The Dosars are Vaishnava Hindus and employ San&#257;dhya Br&#257;hmans as their priests. These Br&#257;hmans will
take food without water from their clients, but they are an inferior class and are looked down upon by other Br&#257;hmans. The
caste are mainly shopkeepers, and they deal in gold and silver ornaments, as well as grain, tobacco and all kinds of groceries.

</span><h2>Bania, Gahoi</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Gahoi.</b><a id="d0e4239src" href="#d0e4239" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;This Hindu subcaste numbered nearly 7000 persons in 1911, belonging principally to the Saugor, <a id="d0e4242"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4242">146</a>]</span>Jubbulpore and Narsinghpur Districts. Their home is the Bundelkhand country, which these Districts adjoin, and they say that
their original headquarters was at Kharagpur in Bundelkhand, whence they have spread over the surrounding country. They tell
a curious story of their origin to the effect that once upon a time there was a certain schoolmaster, one Biya P&#257;nde Br&#257;hman,
who could foretell the future. One day he was in his school with his boys when he foresaw that there was about to be an earthquake.
He immediately warned his boys to get out of the building, and himself led the way. Only twelve of the boys had followed,
and the others were still hesitating, when the earthquake began, the school fell in, and they were all buried in the ruins.
The schoolmaster formed the boys who had escaped into one caste, calling them Gahoi, which is supposed to mean that which
is left or the residue; and he determined that he and his descendants would be the priests of the new caste. At the weddings
of the Gahois an image of the schoolmaster is painted on the house wall, and the bridegroom worships it with offerings of
butter and flowers. The story indicates clearly that the Gahois are of mixed descent from several castes.

</p>
<p>The subcaste has twelve <i>gotras</i> or sections, and seventy-two <i>al</i> or <i>&#257;nken</i>, which are subsections of the <i>gotras</i>. Several of the <i>al</i> names appear to be of a titular or totemistic character, as Mor peacock, Sohania beautiful, Nagaria a drummer, Pah&#257;ria a
hillman, Matele the name of a village headman in Bundelkhand, Piparv&#257;nia from the p&#299;pal tree, Dadaria a singer. The rule of
exogamy is said to be that a man must not marry in his own <i>gotra</i> nor in the <i>al</i> of his mother or either grandmother.<a id="d0e4267src" href="#d0e4267" class="noteref">2</a> Their weddings are held only at the bride&#8217;s house, no ceremonies being performed at the bridegroom&#8217;s; at the ceremony the
bridegroom stands in the centre of the shed by the marriage-post and the bride walks seven times round him. At their weddings
the Gahois still use the old rupees of the N&#257;gpur kingdom for presents and payments to menials, and they hoard them up, when
they can get them, for this special purpose. The rupee is sacred with the Bania, and this is an instance of the preservation
of old accessories for religious ceremonies <a id="d0e4273"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4273">147</a>]</span>when they have been superseded in ordinary use. Polygamy is permitted, but is rare. The Gahois employ Bh&#257;rgava Br&#257;hmans for
their priests, and these are presumably the descendants of the schoolmaster who founded the caste. At the thirteenth-day feast
after a death the Br&#257;hmans must be fed first before the members of the caste. On this occasion thirteen brass or earthen vessels
are filled with flour, and a piece of money, and presented to thirteen Br&#257;hmans, while the family priest receives a bed and
piece of cloth. The priests are said to be greedy, and to raise quarrels over the value of the presents given to them. At
the Diw&#257;li festival the Gahois worship the implements of their trade, pen and ink, and their account-books. The Gahois are
Vaishnava Hindus, and abstain from all flesh and alcoholic liquor. They trade in grain and groceries, and are bankers and
moneylenders. They are considered to be cunning in business, and a proverb says that a Gahoi will deceive even his own father.

</span><h2>Bania, Golap&#363;rab</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Golap&#363;rab, Golahre.</b>&#8212;This Jain subcaste numbers about 6000 persons in the Central Provinces, and belongs mainly to the Saugor, Damoh and Narsinghpur
Districts. Its distribution is nearly the same as that of the Gahois, and it is probably also a Bundelkhand group. The Golap&#363;rabs
are practically all Digambari Jains with a small Hindu minority. In some localities they intermarry with Parw&#257;r Banias who
are also Digambari Jains; and they will take food cooked without water from the Nema subcaste who are Hindus. According to
one story the Golap&#363;rabs were the offspring of a P&#363;rabia, that is probably a Bais R&#257;jp&#363;t, by a kept woman of the Ah&#299;r caste.
This fits in very well with the name, as Golak means a bastard, and the termination <i>p&#363;rab</i> would be from P&#363;rabia; but it is probably the name which has given rise to the story, or at any rate to the supposed descent
from a P&#363;rabia. In the United Provinces a small subcaste of Bania called Golahre exists, belonging to the Jh&#257;nsi District,
that is the country of the Golap&#363;rabs, and Jain by religion. There is no doubt that this group is the same as the Golap&#363;rabs,
and Mr. Crooke derives<a id="d0e4285src" href="#d0e4285" class="noteref">1</a> the <a id="d0e4290"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4290">148</a>]</span>name from <i>gola</i>, a grain-mart, which seems more probable than the derivation suggested above. But it is an interesting fact that there is
also a caste of cultivators called Golap&#363;rab in the United Provinces, found only in the Agra District. It is suggested that
these people are the illegitimate offspring of San&#257;dhya Br&#257;hmans, with whom they appear to be closely connected. From their
sept-names, however, which include those of several R&#257;jp&#363;t clans and also some titular terms of a low-caste type, Mr. Crooke
thinks their Br&#257;hmanical origin improbable. It is noticeable that these Golap&#363;rabs though a cultivating caste have, like the
Banias, a subcaste called Dasa, comprising persons of irregular descent; they also prohibit the remarriage of widows, and
abstain from all flesh and from onions and garlic. Such customs are peculiar in a cultivating caste, and resemble those of
Banias. It seems possible that a detailed investigation might give ground for supposing that both the Golahre and Golap&#363;rab
subcastes of Banias in the United and Central Provinces respectively are connected with this cultivating caste of Golap&#363;rabs.
The latter might have abandoned the Jain religion on taking to cultivation, as a Jain cannot well drive the plough, which
involves destruction of animal life; or the Bania section might have adopted Jainism in order to obtain a better social position
and differentiate themselves from the cultivators. Unfortunately no detailed information about the Golap&#363;rabs of the Central
Provinces is available, from which the probability or otherwise of this hypothesis could be tested.

<p><b>Bania, Kasarw&#257;ni</b>.<a id="d0e4302src" href="#d0e4302" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;This Hindu subcaste numbers about 6500 persons in the Central Provinces, who belong mainly to Saugor, Jubbulpore and the
three Chhatt&#299;sgarh Districts. The name is probably derived from <i>k&#257;nsa</i>, bell-metal, as these Banias retail brass and bell-metal vessels. The Kasarw&#257;nis may therefore not improbably be an occupational
group formed from persons who engaged in the trade, and in that case they may be wholly or partly derived from the Kas&#257;rs
and Tameras, the castes which work in brass, copper <a id="d0e4308"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4308">149</a>]</span>and bell-metal. The Kasarw&#257;nis are numerous in Allah&#257;b&#257;d and M&#299;rz&#257;pur, and they may have come to Chhatt&#299;sgarh from M&#299;rz&#257;pur,
attracted by the bell-metal industries in Ratanpur and Dr&#363;g. In Saugor and also in the United Provinces they say that they
came from Kara M&#257;nikpur several generations ago. If the selling of metal vessels was their original calling, many, or the
majority of them, have now abandoned it, and deal in grain and groceries, and lend money like other Banias. The Kasarw&#257;nis
do not observe the same standard of strictness as the good Bania subcastes in their social rules. They eat the flesh of goats,
sheep, birds and fish, though they abstain from liquor. They permit the remarriage of widows and divorce; and women who have
been divorced can marry again in the caste by the same rite as widows. They also allow the exchange of girls in marriage between
two families. They do not as a rule wear the sacred thread. Their priests are Sarwaria Br&#257;hmans, and these Br&#257;hmans and a
few Bania subcastes, such as the Agarw&#257;las, Umres and Gahois, can take food cooked without water from them, but other Br&#257;hmans
and R&#257;jp&#363;ts will not take any kind of food. Matches are arranged in the presence of the head of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i>, who is known as Chaudhri. The parents on each side give their consent, and in pledge of it six pice (farthings) are taken
from both of them, mixed together and given to their family priests and barbers, four pice to the priests and two to the barbers.
The following is a local derivation of the name; the word <i>kasar</i> means more or the increase, and <i>bhata</i> means less; and <i>Ham&#257;ra kya kasar bhata?</i> means &#8216;How does my account stand?&#8217; Hence Kasarb&#257;ni is one who keeps accounts, that is a Bania.

<p><b>Bania, Kasaundhan.</b>&#8212;This subcaste numbers about 5500 persons in the Central Provinces and is returned principally from the Bil&#257;spur, Raipur and
Jubbulpore Districts. The name is derived<a id="d0e4329src" href="#d0e4329" class="noteref">1</a> by Mr. Crooke from <i>k&#257;nsa</i>, bell-metal, and <i>dhana</i>, wealth, and it would appear that the Kasaundhans like the Kas&#257;rwanis are an occupational group, made up of shopkeepers who
dealt in metal vessels. Like them also the <a id="d0e4340"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4340">150</a>]</span>Kasaundhans may have originally been constituted from the metal-working castes, and indeed they may be only a local branch
of the Kasarw&#257;nis, though no information is available which would decide this point. In the United Provinces both the Kasarw&#257;nis
and Kasaundhans are divided into the P&#363;rbia or eastern and Pachhaiy&#257;n or western subcastes. Dharam Das, the great disciple
of Kab&#299;r, who founded the Kab&#299;rpanthi sect in the Central Provinces, was a Kasaundhan Bania, and the Kab&#299;rpanthi Mahants or
high-priests of Kawardha are of this caste. It is probable that a good many of the Kasaundhan Banias in Bil&#257;spur and Raipur
belong to the Kab&#299;rpanthi sect. The remainder are ordinary Hindus.

</span><h2>Bania, Ling&#257;yat</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Ling&#257;yat.</b>&#8212;The Ling&#257;yat Banias number nearly 8000 persons in the Central Provinces, being numerous in Wardha, N&#257;gpur and all the Ber&#257;r
Districts. A brief account of the Ling&#257;yat sect has been given in a separate article. The Ling&#257;yat Banias form a separate
endogamous group, and they do not eat or intermarry either with other Banias or with members of other castes belonging to
the Ling&#257;yat sect. But they retain the name and occupation of Banias. They have five subdivisions, Pancham, Diksh&#257;want, Chilliwant,
Takalkar and Kanade. The Pancham or Panchams&#257;lis are the descendants of the original Br&#257;hman converts to the Ling&#257;yat sect.
They are the main body of the community and are initiated by what is known as the eight-fold sacrament or <i>eshta-varna</i>. The Diksh&#257;want, from <i>diksha</i> or initiation, are a subdivision of the Panchams&#257;lis, who apparently initiate disciples like the Dikshit Br&#257;hmans. The Takalkar
are said to take their name from a forest called Takali, where their first ancestress bore a child to the god Siva. The Kanade
are from Canara. The meaning of the term Chilliwant is not known; it is said that a member of this subcaste will throw away
his food or water if it is seen by any one who is not a Ling&#257;yat, and they shave the whole head. The above form endogamous
subcastes. The Ling&#257;yat Banias also have exogamous groups, the names of which are mainly titular, of a low-caste type. Instances
of them are Kaode, from <i>kawa</i> a crow, Teli an oil-seller, Thubri a dwarf, Ubadkar an incendiary, Gudkari a sugar-seller and Dh&#257;mankar from Dh&#257;mangaon.
They say that the <i>maths</i> or exogamous groups are no longer regarded, and that marriage is now prohibited between persons having the same surname.
It is stated that if a girl is not married before adolescence she is finally expelled from the caste, but this rule has probably
become obsolete. The proposal for marriage comes from either the boy&#8217;s or girl&#8217;s party, and sometimes the bridegroom receives
a small sum for his travelling expenses, while at other times a bride-price <a id="d0e4391"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4391">152</a>]</span>is paid. At the wedding, rice coloured red is put in the hands of the bridegroom and ju&#257;ri coloured yellow in those of the
bride. The bridegroom places the rice on the bride&#8217;s head and she lays the ju&#257;ri at his feet. A dish full of water with a
golden ring in it is put between them, and they lay their hands on the ring together under the water and walk five times round
a decorative little marriage-shed erected inside the real one. A feast is given, and the bridal couple sit on a little dais
and eat out of the same dish. The remarriage of widows is permitted, but the widow may not marry a man belonging to the section
either of her first husband or of her father. Divorce is recognised. The Ling&#257;yats bury the dead in a sitting posture with
the <i>lingam</i> or emblem of Siva, which has never left the dead man during his lifetime, clasped in his right hand. Sometimes a platform
is made over the grave with an image of Siva. They do not shave the head in token of mourning. Their principal festival is
Shivr&#257;tri or Siva&#8217;s night, when they offer the leaves of the bel tree and ashes to the god. A Ling&#257;yat must never be without
the <i>lingam</i> or phallic sign of Siva, which is carried slung round the neck in a little case of silver, copper or brass. If he loses it,
he must not eat, drink nor smoke until he finds it or obtains another. The Ling&#257;yats do not employ Br&#257;hmans for any purpose,
but are served by their own priests, the Jangams,<a id="d0e4399src" href="#d0e4399" class="noteref">1</a> who are recruited both by descent and by initiation from members of the Pancham group. The Ling&#257;yat Banias are practically
all immigrants from the Telugu country; they have Telugu names and speak this language in their homes. They deal in grain,
cloth, groceries and spices.

devotions they had interrupted in the forest. But when their wives came to commit <i>sati</i> by the stone figures the god Siva intervened and brought them to life again. He told them to give up the profession of arms
and take to trade. So the seventy-two followers were the ancestors of the seventy-two <i>gotras</i> or sections of the Maheshris, and the R&#257;ja became their tribal <i>Bh&#257;t</i> or genealogist, and they were called Maheshri or Maheswari, from Mahesh, a name of Siva. In Gujar&#257;t the term Maheshri or
Meshri appears to be used for all Banias who are not Jains, including the other important Hindu subcastes.<a id="d0e4420src" href="#d0e4420" class="noteref">1</a> This is somewhat peculiar, and perhaps tends to show that several of the local subcastes are of recent formation. But though
they profess to be named after Siva, the Maheshris, like practically all other Hindu Banias, are Vaishnava by sect, and wear
the <i>kunti</i> or necklace of beads of basil. A small minority are Jains. It is to be noticed that both the place of their origin, an early
R&#257;jp&#363;t settlement of the Y&#257;dava clan, and their own legend tend to show that they were derived from the R&#257;jp&#363;t caste; for
as their ancestors were attendants on a R&#257;ja and followed the profession of arms, which they were told to abandon, they could
be none other than R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The Maheshris also have the R&#257;jp&#363;t custom of sending a cocoanut as a symbol of a proposal of marriage.
In Nim&#257;r the Maheshri Banias say they belong to the Dh&#257;kar subcaste, a name which usually means illegitimate, though they
themselves explain that it is derived from a place called Dh&#257;kargarh, from which they migrated. As already stated they are
divided into seventy-two exogamous clans, the names of which appear to be titular or territorial. It is said that at their
weddings when the bridegroom gets to the door of the marriage-shed, the bride&#8217;s mother ties a scarf round his neck and takes
hold of his nose and drags him into the shed. Sometimes they make the bridegroom kneel down and pay reverence to a shoe as
a joke. They do not observe the custom of the <i>pangat</i> or formal festal assembly, which is usual among Hindu castes; according to this, none <a id="d0e4434"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4434">154</a>]</span>can begin to eat until all the guests have assembled, when they all sit down at once. Among the Maheshris the guests sit down
as they come in, and are served and take their food and go. They only have the <i>pangat</i> feast on very rare occasions. The Maheshris are one of the richest, most enterprising and influential classes of Banias.
They are intelligent, of high-bred appearance, cleanly habits and courteous manners. The great bankers, Sir Kast&#363;rchand Daga
of Kamptee, of the firm of Bansi L&#257;l Ab&#299;rchand, and Rai Bah&#257;dur Seth J&#299;wan Das and Diw&#257;n Bah&#257;dur Seth Ballabh Das, of Jubbulpore,
belong to this subcaste.

</span><h2>Bania, Nema</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Nema.</b>&#8212;This subcaste numbers nearly 4000 persons, the bulk of whom reside in the Saugor, Damoh, Narsinghpur and Seoni Districts.
The Nemas are most largely returned from Central India, and are probably a Bundelkhand group; they will eat food cooked without
water with Golap&#363;rab Banias, who are also found in Bundelkhand. They are mainly Hindus, with a small minority of Jains. The
origin of the name is obscure; the suggestion that it comes from Nim&#257;r appears to be untenable, as there are very few Nemas
in that District. They say that when Parasur&#257;ma was slaying the Kshatriyas fourteen young R&#257;jp&#363;t princes, who at the time
were studying religion with their family priests, were saved by the latter on renouncing their Kshatriya status and declaring
themselves to be Vaishyas. These fourteen princes were the ancestors of the fourteen <i>gotras</i> of the Nema subcaste, but the <i>gotras</i> actually bear the names of the fourteen R&#299;shis or saints who saved their lives. These sections appear to be of the usual
Br&#257;hmanical type, but marriage is regulated by another set of fifty-two subsections, with names which are apparently titular
or territorial. Like other Bania groups the Nemas are divided into B&#299;sa and Dasa subdivisions or twenties and tens, the B&#299;sa
being of pure and the Dasa of irregular descent. There is also a third group of Pacha or fives, who appear to be the offspring
of kept women. After some generations, when the details of their ancestry are forgotten, the Pachas probably obtain promotion
into the Dasa group. The B&#299;sa and Dasa groups take food together, but do not intermarry. The Nemas wear <a id="d0e4452"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4452">155</a>]</span>the sacred thread and apparently prohibit the remarriage of widows. The Nemas are considered to be very keen business men,
and a saying about them is, &#8220;Where a sheep grazes or a Nema trades, what is there left for anybody else?&#8221;

</span><h2>Bania, Osw&#257;l</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Osw&#257;l.</b>&#8212;This is perhaps the most important subdivision of the Banias after the Agarw&#257;la. The Osw&#257;ls numbered nearly 10,000 persons
in the Central Provinces in 1911, being found in considerable numbers in all the Ber&#257;r Districts, and also in Nim&#257;r, Wardha
and Raipur. The name is derived from the town of Osia or Osnagar in M&#257;rw&#257;r. According to one legend of their origin the R&#257;ja
of Osnagar had no son, and obtained one through the promise of a Jain ascetic. The people then drove the ascetic from the
town, fearing that the R&#257;ja would become a Jain; but Osadev, the guardian goddess of the place, told the ascetic, Sri Ratan
Suri, to convert the R&#257;ja by a miracle. So she took a small hank (<i>p&#363;ni</i>) of cotton and passed it along the back of the saint, when it immediately became a snake and bit Jaichand, the son of the
R&#257;ja, in the toe, while he was asleep beside his wife. Every means was tried to save his life, but he died. As his corpse
was about to be burnt, the ascetic sent one of his disciples and stopped the cremation. Then the R&#257;ja came with the body of
his son and stood with hands clasped before the saint. He ordered that it was to be taken back to the place where the prince
had been bitten, and that the princess was to lie down beside it as before. At midnight the snake returned and licked the
bite, when the prince was restored to life. Then the R&#257;ja, with all his Court and people, became a Jain. He and his family
founded the <i>gotra</i> or section now known as Sri Srim&#257;l or most noble; his servants formed that known as Srim&#257;l or excellent, while the other
R&#257;jp&#363;ts of the town became ordinary Osw&#257;ls. When the Br&#257;hmans of the place heard of these conversions they asked the saint
how they were to live, as all their clients had become Jains. The saint directed that they should continue to be the family
priests of the Osw&#257;ls and be known as Bhojak or &#8216;eaters.&#8217; Thus the Osw&#257;ls, though Jains, continue to employ M&#257;rw&#257;ri <a id="d0e4467"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4467">156</a>]</span>Br&#257;hmans as their family priests. Another version of the story is that the king of Srim&#257;li<a id="d0e4469src" href="#d0e4469" class="noteref">1</a> allowed no one who was not a millionaire to live within his city walls. In consequence of this a large number of persons
left Srim&#257;l, and, settling in Mandovad, called it Osa or the frontier. Among them were Srim&#257;li Banias and also Bhatti, Chauh&#257;n,
Gahlot, Gaur, Y&#257;dava, and several other clans of R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and these were the people who were subsequently converted by the
Jain ascetic, Sri Ratan Suri, and formed into the single caste of Osw&#257;l.<a id="d0e4472src" href="#d0e4472" class="noteref">2</a> Finally, Colonel Tod states that the Osw&#257;ls are all of pure R&#257;jp&#363;t descent, of no single tribe, but chiefly Panw&#257;rs, Solankis
and Bhattis.<a id="d0e4480src" href="#d0e4480" class="noteref">3</a> From these legends and the fact that their headquarters are in R&#257;jput&#257;na, it may safely be concluded that the Osw&#257;l Banias
are of R&#257;jp&#363;t origin.

</p>
<p>The large majority of the Osw&#257;ls are Jain by religion, but a few are Vaishnava Hindus. Intermarriage between the Hindu and
Jain sections is permitted. Like the Agarw&#257;las, the Osw&#257;ls are divided into B&#299;sa, Dasa and Pacha sections or twenties, tens
and fives, according to the purity of their lineage. The Pacha subcaste still permit the remarriage of widows. The three groups
take food together but do not intermarry. In Bombay, Dasa Osw&#257;ls intermarry with the Dasa groups of Srim&#257;li and Parw&#257;r Banias,<a id="d0e4487src" href="#d0e4487" class="noteref">4</a> and Osw&#257;ls generally can marry with other good Bania subcastes so long as both parties are Jains. The Osw&#257;ls are divided
into eighty-four <i>gotras</i> or exogamous sections for purposes of marriage, a list of which is given by Mr. Crooke.<a id="d0e4501src" href="#d0e4501" class="noteref">5</a> Most of these cannot be recognised, but a few of them seem to be titular, as Lorha a caste which grows hemp, Nunia a salt-refiner,
Seth a banker, Daftari an office-boy, Vaid a physician, Bhand&#257;ri a cook, and Kukara a dog. These may indicate a certain amount
of admixture of foreign elements in the caste. As stated from Ben&#257;res, the exogamous rule is that a man cannot marry in his
own section, and he cannot marry a girl whose father&#8217;s or mother&#8217;s section is the same as that of either his father or mother.
This would bar the marriage of first cousins.
<a id="d0e4506"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4506">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>Though Jains the Osw&#257;ls perform their weddings by walking round the sacred fire and observe certain Hindu rites, including
the worship of the god Ganpati.<a id="d0e4509src" href="#d0e4509" class="noteref">6</a> They also revere other Hindu deities and the sun and moon. The dead are burnt, but they do not observe any impurity after
a death nor clean the house. On the day after the death the mourning family, both men and women, visit Parasn&#257;th&#8217;s temple,
and lay one seer (2 lbs.) of Indian millet before the god, bow to him and go home. They do not gather the ashes of the dead
nor keep the yearly death-day. Their only observance is that on some day between the twelfth day after a death and the end
of a year, the caste-people are treated to a dinner of sweetmeats and the dead &#8216;are then forgotten.&#8217;<a id="d0e4514src" href="#d0e4514" class="noteref">7</a> The Osw&#257;ls will take food cooked with water (<i>katchi</i>) only from Br&#257;hmans, and that cooked without water (<i>pakki</i>) from Agarw&#257;la and Maheshri Banias. In the Central Provinces the principal deity of the Osw&#257;ls is the Jain Tirthak&#257;r Parasn&#257;th,
and they spend large sums in the erection of splendid temples. The Osw&#257;ls are the most prominent trading caste in R&#257;jput&#257;na;
and they have also frequently held high offices, such as Diw&#257;n or minister, and paymaster in R&#257;jp&#363;t States.<a id="d0e4524src" href="#d0e4524" class="noteref">8</a>

</span><h2>Bania, Parw&#257;r</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4533">
<h3>1. Origin.</h3>
<p><b>Bania, Parw&#257;r.</b><a id="d0e4539src" href="#d0e4539" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;This Jain subcaste numbered nearly 29,000 persons in 1911. They belong almost entirely to the Jubbulpore and Nerbudda Divisions,
and the great bulk are found in the Saugor, Damoh and Jubbulpore Districts. The origin of the Parw&#257;rs and of their name is
not known, but there is some reason to suppose that they are from R&#257;jput&#257;na. Their women wear on the head the <i>b&#299;j</i>, a R&#257;jput&#257;na ornament, and use the <i>ch&#257;ru</i>, a deep brass plate for drinking, which also belongs there. Their songs are said to be in the R&#257;jasth&#257;ni dialect. It seems
likely that the Parw&#257;rs may be identical with the Poraw&#257;l subcaste found in other Provinces, which, judging from the name,
may belong to R&#257;jput&#257;na. In the northern Districts the Parw&#257;rs <a id="d0e4548"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4548">158</a>]</span>speak Bundeli, but in the south their language is said to be M&#257;rw&#257;ri.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4550">
<h3>2. Subdivisions.</h3>
<p>Among the Parw&#257;rs the Samaiya or Chann&#257;gri form a separate sectarian Jain group. They do not worship the images of the Jain
Tirthak&#257;rs, but enshrine the sacred books of the Jains in their temples, and worship these. The Parw&#257;rs will take daughters
in marriage from the Chann&#257;gris, and sometimes give their daughters in consideration of a substantial bride-price. Among the
Parw&#257;rs themselves there is a social division between the Ath S&#257;ke and the Chao S&#257;ke; the former will not permit the marriage
of persons related more nearly than eight degrees, while the latter permit it after four degrees. The Ath S&#257;ke have the higher
position, and if one of them marries a Chao S&#257;ke he is degraded to that group. Besides this the Parw&#257;rs have an inferior division
called Benaikia, which consists of the offspring of irregular unions and of widows who have remarried. Persons who have committed
a caste offence and cannot pay the fine imposed on them for it also go into this subcaste. The Benaikias<a id="d0e4555src" href="#d0e4555" class="noteref">2</a> themselves are distributed into four groups of varying degrees of respectability, and families who live correctly and marry
as well as they can tend to rise from one to the other until after several generations they may again be recognised as Parw&#257;rs
proper.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4558">
<h3>3. Exogamy.</h3>
<p>The Parw&#257;rs have twelve <i>gotras</i> or main sections, and each <i>gotra</i> has, or is supposed to have, twelve <i>muls</i> or subsections. A Parw&#257;r must not marry in his own <i>gotra</i> nor in the <i>mul</i> of his mother, or any of his grandmothers or greatgrandmothers. This practically bars marriage within seven degrees of relationship.
But a man&#8217;s sister and daughter may be married in the same family, and even to two brothers, and a man can marry two sisters.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4578">
<h3>4. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>As a rule no bride-price is paid, but occasionally an old man desiring a wife will give something substantial to her father
in secret. There are two forms of marriage, called Thinga and Dajanha; in the former, women do not accompany the wedding procession,
and they have a separate marriage-shed at the bridegroom&#8217;s house for their own celebrations; while in the latter, they accompany
it <a id="d0e4583"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4583">159</a>]</span>and erect such a shed at the house in the bridegroom&#8217;s village or town where they have their lodging. Before the wedding,
the bridegroom, mounted on a horse, and the bride, carried in a litter, proceed together round the marriage-shed. The bridegroom
then stands by the sacred post in the centre and the bride walks seven times round him. In the evening there was a custom
of dressing the principal male relatives of the bridegroom in women&#8217;s clothes and making them dance, but this is now being
discarded. On the fifth day is held a rite called Palkach&#257;r. A new cot is provided by the bride&#8217;s father, and on it is spread
a red cloth. The couple are seated on this with their hands entwined, and their relations come and make them presents. If
the bridegroom catches hold of the dress of his mother- or father-in-law, they are expected to make him a handsome present.
In other respects the wedding follows the ordinary Hindu ritual. Widow-marriage and divorce are forbidden among the Parw&#257;rs
proper, and those who practise them go into the lower Benaikia group.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4585">
<h3>5. Religion: Hindu observances.</h3>
<p>The Parw&#257;rs are practically all Jains of the Digambari sect. They build costly and beautiful temples for their Tirthak&#257;rs,
especially for their favourite Parasn&#257;th. They have also many Hindu practices. They observe the Diw&#257;li, Rakshabandhan and
Holi festivals; they say that at the Diw&#257;li the last Tirthak&#257;r Mah&#257;v&#299;ra attained beatitude and the gods rained down jewels;
the little lamps now lighted at Diw&#257;li are held to be symbolic of these jewels. They tie the threads round the wrist on Rakshabandhan
to keep off evil spirits. They worship S&#299;tala Devi, the Hindu goddess of smallpox, and employ Br&#257;hmans to choose names for
their children and fix the dates of their wedding and other ceremonies, though not at the ceremonies themselves.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4590">
<h3>6. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
<p>The caste burn the dead, with the exception of the bodies of young children, which are buried. The corpse is sometimes placed
sitting in a car to be taken to the cremation ground, but often laid on a bier in the ordinary manner. The sitting posture
is that in which all the Tirthak&#257;rs attained paradise, and their images always represent them in this posture. The corpse
is naked save for <a id="d0e4595"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4595">160</a>]</span>a new piece of cloth round the waist, but it is covered with a sheet. The Jains do not shave their hair in token of mourning,
nor do they offer sacrificial cakes to the dead. When the body is burnt they bathe in the nearest water and go home. Neither
the bearers nor the mourners are held to be impure. Next day the mourning family, both men and women, visit Parasn&#257;th&#8217;s temple,
lay two pounds of Indian millet before the god and go home.<a id="d0e4597src" href="#d0e4597" class="noteref">3</a> But in the Central Provinces they whitewash their houses, get their clothes washed, throw away their earthen pots and give
a feast to the caste.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e4602">
<h3>7. Social rules and customs.</h3>
<p>The Parw&#257;rs abstain from eating any kind of flesh and from drinking liquor. They have a <i>panch&#257;yat</i> and impose penalties for offences against caste rules like the Hindus. Among the offences are the killing of any living thing,
unchastity or adultery, theft or other bad conduct, taking cooked food or water from a caste from which the Parw&#257;rs do not
take them, and violation of any rule of their religion. To get vermin in a wound, or to be beaten by a low-caste man or with
a shoe, incidents which entail serious penalties among the Hindus, are not offences with the Parw&#257;rs. When an offender is
put out of caste the ordinary deprivation is that he is not allowed to enter a Jain temple, and in serious cases he may also
not eat nor drink with the caste. The Parw&#257;rs are generally engaged in the trade in grain, <i>gh&#299;</i>, and other staples. Several of them are well-to-do and own villages.

</span><h2>Bania, Srim&#257;li</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Srim&#257;li.</b>&#8212;This subcaste takes its name from the town of Srim&#257;l, which is now Bhinm&#257;l in M&#257;rw&#257;r. They numbered 600 persons in the Central
Provinces in 1911, most of whom belonged to the Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d District. More than two-thirds were Hindus and the remainder Jains.
Colonel Tod writes of Bhinm&#257;l and an adjoining town, Sanchor: &#8220;These towns are on the high road to Cutch and Gujar&#257;t, which
has given them from the most remote times a commercial celebrity. Bhinm&#257;l is said to contain about 1500 houses and Sanchor
half that number. Very wealthy <i>mah&#257;jans</i> or merchants used to reside here, but insecurity <a id="d0e4623"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4623">161</a>]</span>both within and without has much injured these cities.&#8221; From Bhinm&#257;l the Srim&#257;lis appear to have gone to Gujar&#257;t, where they
are found in considerable numbers. Their legend of origin is that the goddess Lakshmi created from a flower-garland 90,000
families to act as servants to the 90,000 Srim&#257;li Br&#257;hmans, and these were the ancestors of the Srim&#257;li Banias.<a id="d0e4625src" href="#d0e4625" class="noteref">1</a> Both the Jain and Hindu sections of the Srim&#257;li Banias employ Srim&#257;li Br&#257;hmans as priests. Like other classes of Banias,
the Srim&#257;li are divided into two sections, the B&#299;sa and Dasa, or twenty and ten, of which the B&#299;sa are considered to be of
pure and the Dasa of somewhat mixed descent. In Gujar&#257;t they also have a third territorial group, known as L&#257;dva, from L&#257;d,
the old name of Gujar&#257;t. All three subdivisions take food together but do not intermarry.<a id="d0e4633src" href="#d0e4633" class="noteref">2</a> The two highest sections of the Osw&#257;l Banias are called Sri Srim&#257;l and Srim&#257;l, and it is possible that further investigation
might show the Srim&#257;ls and Osw&#257;ls to have been originally of one stock.

</span><h2>Bania, Umre</h2>
<p><b>Bania, Umre.</b>&#8212;This Hindu subcaste belongs to Damoh and Jubbulpore. They are perhaps the same as the Ummar Banias of the United Provinces,
who reside in the Meerut, Agra and Kumaon Divisions. The name Umre is found as a subdivision of several castes in the Central
Provinces, as the Telis and others, and is probably derived from some town or tract of country in northern or central India,
but no identification has been made. Mr. Bh&#299;mbhai Kirp&#257;r&#257;m states that in Gujar&#257;t the Ummar Banias are also known as B&#257;garia
from the B&#257;gar or wild country, comprised in the Dongarpur and Pert&#257;bgarh States of R&#257;jput&#257;na, where considerable numbers
of them are still settled. Their headquarters is at S&#257;gw&#257;ra, near Dongarpur.<a id="d0e4644src" href="#d0e4644" class="noteref">1</a> In Damoh the Umre Banias formerly cultivated the <i>al</i> plant,<a id="d0e4652src" href="#d0e4652" class="noteref">2</a> which yielded a well-known dye, and hence they lost caste, as in soaking the roots of the plant to extract the dye the numerous
insects in them are necessarily destroyed. The Dosar subcaste<a id="d0e4657src" href="#d0e4657" class="noteref">3</a> are a branch of the Umre, who allow widow-remarriage.

<h3>1. Historical notice of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Banj&#257;ra, Wanj&#257;ri, Lah&#257;na, Mukeri</b>.<a id="d0e4784src" href="#d0e4784" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;The caste of carriers and drivers of pack-bullocks. In 1911 the Banj&#257;ras numbered about 56,000 persons in the Central Provinces
and 80,000 in Ber&#257;r, the caste being in greater strength here than in any part of India except Hyder&#257;b&#257;d, where their total
is 174,000. Bombay comes next with a figure approaching that of the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r, and the caste belongs therefore
rather to the Deccan than to northern India. The name has been variously explained, but the most probable derivation is from
the Sanskrit <a id="d0e4799"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4799">163</a>]</span><i>banijya kara</i>, a merchant. Sir H. M. Elliot held that the name Banj&#257;ra was of great antiquity, quoting a passage from the Dasa Kumara Charita
of the eleventh or twelfth century. But it was subsequently shown by Professor Cowell that the name Banj&#257;ra did not occur
in the original text of this work.<a id="d0e4803src" href="#d0e4803" class="noteref">2</a> Banj&#257;ras are supposed to be the people mentioned by Arrian in the fourth century B.C., as leading a wandering life, dwelling
in tents and letting out for hire their beasts of burden.<a id="d0e4809src" href="#d0e4809" class="noteref">3</a> But this passage merely proves the existence of carriers and not of the Banj&#257;ra caste. Mr. Crooke states<a id="d0e4814src" href="#d0e4814" class="noteref">4</a> that the first mention of Banj&#257;ras in Muhammadan history is in Sikandar&#8217;s attack on Dholpur in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1504.<a id="d0e4822src" href="#d0e4822" class="noteref">5</a> It seems improbable, therefore, that the Banj&#257;ras accompanied the different Muhammadan invaders of India, as might have been
inferred from the fact that they came into the Deccan in the train of the forces of Aur&#257;ngzeb. The caste has indeed two Muhammadan
sections, the Turkia and Mukeri.<a id="d0e4837src" href="#d0e4837" class="noteref">6</a> But both of these have the same R&#257;jp&#363;t clan names as the Hindu branch of the caste, and it seems possible that they may have
embraced Isl&#257;m under the proselytising influence of Aur&#257;ngzeb, or simply owing to their having been employed with the Muhammadan
troops. The great bulk of the caste in southern India are Hindus, and there seems no reason for assuming that its origin was
Muhammadan.

<div class="div2" id="d0e4843">
<h3>2. Banj&#257;ras derived from the Ch&#257;rans or Bh&#257;ts.</h3>
<p>It may be suggested that the Banj&#257;ras are derived from the Ch&#257;ran or Bh&#257;t caste of R&#257;jput&#257;na. Mr. Cumberlege, whose <i>Monograph</i> on the caste in Ber&#257;r is one of the best authorities, states that of the four divisions existing there the Ch&#257;rans are the
most numerous and by far the most interesting class.<a id="d0e4851src" href="#d0e4851" class="noteref">7</a> In the article on Bh&#257;t it has been explained how the Ch&#257;rans or bards, owing to their readiness <a id="d0e4856"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4856">164</a>]</span>to kill themselves rather than give up the property entrusted to their care, became the best safe-conduct for the passage
of goods in R&#257;jput&#257;na. The name Ch&#257;ran is generally held to mean &#8216;Wanderer,&#8217; and in their capacity of bards the Ch&#257;rans were
accustomed to travel from court to court of the different chiefs in quest of patronage. They were first protected by their
sacred character and afterwards by their custom of <i>tr&#257;ga</i> or <i>ch&#257;ndi</i>, that is, of killing themselves when attacked and threatening their assailants with the dreaded fate of being haunted by
their ghosts. Mr. Bhimbhai Kirpar&#257;m<a id="d0e4864src" href="#d0e4864" class="noteref">8</a> remarks: &#8220;After Par&#257;sur&#257;ma&#8217;s dispersion of the Kshatris the Ch&#257;rans accompanied them in their southward flight. In those
troubled times the Ch&#257;rans took charge of the supplies of the Kshatri forces and so fell to their present position of cattle-breeders
and grain-carriers....&#8221; Most of the Ch&#257;rans are graziers, cattle-sellers and pack-carriers. Colonel Tod says:<a id="d0e4871src" href="#d0e4871" class="noteref">9</a> &#8220;The Ch&#257;rans and Bh&#257;ts or bards and genealogists are the chief carriers of these regions (M&#257;rw&#257;r); their sacred character
overawes the lawless R&#257;jp&#363;t chief, and even the savage Koli and Bh&#299;l and the plundering Sahrai of the desert dread the anathema
of these singular races, who conduct the caravans through the wildest and most desolate regions.&#8221; In another passage Colonel
Tod identifies the Ch&#257;rans and Banj&#257;ras<a id="d0e4876src" href="#d0e4876" class="noteref">10</a> as follows: &#8220;Murl&#257;h is an excellent township inhabited by a community of Ch&#257;rans of the tribe Cucholia (Kacheli), who are
Bunj&#257;rris (carriers) by profession, though poets by birth. The alliance is a curious one, and would appear incongruous were
not gain the object generally in both cases. It was the sanctity of their office which converted our <i>bardais</i> (bards) into <i>bunj&#257;rris</i>, for their persons being sacred, the immunity extended likewise to their goods and saved them from all imposts; so that in
process of time they became the free-traders of R&#257;jput&#257;na. I was highly gratified with the reception I received from the community,
which collectively advanced to meet me at some distance from the town. The procession was headed by the village elders and
all the fair Ch&#257;ranis, who, as they approached, gracefully waved their <a id="d0e4887"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4887">165</a>]</span>scarfs over me until I was fairly made captive by the muses of Murl&#257;h! It was a novel and interesting scene. The manly persons
of the Ch&#257;rans, clad in the flowing white robe with the high loose-folded turban inclined on one side, from which the <i>m&#257;la</i> or chaplet was gracefully suspended; and the <i>naiques</i> or leaders, with their massive necklaces of gold, with the image of the <i>pitriswar</i> (<i>manes</i>) depending therefrom, gave the whole an air of opulence and dignity. The females were uniformly attired in a skirt of dark-brown
camlet, having a bodice of light-coloured stuff, with gold ornaments worked into their fine black hair; and all had the favourite
<i>ch&#363;ris</i> or rings of <i>h&#257;thid&#257;nt</i> (elephant&#8217;s tooth) covering the arm from the wrist to the elbow, and even above it.&#8221; A little later, referring to the same
Ch&#257;ran community, Colonel Tod writes: &#8220;The <i>t&#257;nda</i> or caravan, consisting of four thousand bullocks, has been kept up amidst all the evils which have beset this land through
Mughal and Mar&#257;tha tyranny. The utility of these caravans as general carriers to conflicting armies and as regular tax-paying
subjects has proved their safeguard, and they were too strong to be pillaged by any petty marauder, as any one who has seen
a Banj&#257;ri encampment will be convinced. They encamp in a square, and their grain-bags piled over each other breast-high, with
interstices left for their matchlocks, make no contemptible fortification. Even the ruthless T&#363;rk, Jamsh&#299;d Kh&#257;n, set up a
protecting tablet in favour of the Ch&#257;rans of Murl&#257;h, recording their exemption from <i>d&#299;nd</i> contributions, and that there should be no increase in duties, with threats to all who should injure the community. As usual,
the sun and moon are appealed to as witnesses of good faith, and sculptured on the stone. Even the forest Bh&#299;l and mountain
Mair have set up their signs of immunity and protection to the chosen of Hingl&#257;z (tutelary deity); and the figures of a cow
and its <i>kairi</i> (calf) carved in rude relief speak the agreement that they should not be slain or stolen within the limits of Murl&#257;h.&#8221;

</p>
<p>In the above passage the community described by Colonel Tod were Ch&#257;rans, but he identified them with Banj&#257;ras, using the
name alternatively. He mentions their <a id="d0e4918"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4918">166</a>]</span>large herds of pack-bullocks, for the management of which the Ch&#257;rans, who were graziers as well as bards, would naturally
be adapted; the name given to the camp, <i>t&#257;nda</i>, is that generally used by the Banj&#257;ras; the women wore ivory bangles, which the Banj&#257;ra women wear.<a id="d0e4923src" href="#d0e4923" class="noteref">11</a> In commenting on the way in which the women threw their scarves over him, making him a prisoner, Colonel Tod remarks: &#8220;This
community had enjoyed for five hundred years the privilege of making prisoner any R&#257;na of Mew&#257;r who may pass through Murl&#257;h,
and keeping him in bondage until he gives them a <i>got</i> or entertainment. The patriarch (of the village) told me that I was in jeopardy as the R&#257;na&#8217;s representative, but not knowing
how I might have relished the joke had it been carried to its conclusion, they let me escape.&#8221; Mr. Ball notes a similar custom
of the Banj&#257;ra women far away in the Bastar State of the Central Provinces:<a id="d0e4929src" href="#d0e4929" class="noteref">12</a> &#8220;Today I passed through another Banj&#257;ra hamlet, from whence the women and girls all hurried out in pursuit, and a brazen-faced
powerful-looking lass seized the bridle of my horse as he was being led by the <i>sais</i> in the rear. The <i>sais</i> and <i>chapr&#257;si</i> were both Muhammadans, and the forward conduct of these females perplexed them not a little, and the former was fast losing
his temper at being thus assaulted by a woman.&#8221; Colonel Mackenzie in his account of the Banj&#257;ra caste remarks:<a id="d0e4943src" href="#d0e4943" class="noteref">13</a> &#8220;It is certain that the Ch&#257;rans, whoever they were, first rose to the demand which the great armies of northern India, contending
in exhausted countries far from their basis of supply, created, viz. the want of a fearless and reliable transport service....
The start which the Ch&#257;rans then acquired they retain among Banj&#257;ras to this day, though in very much diminished splendour
and position. As they themselves relate, they were originally five brethren, R&#257;thor, Turi, Panw&#257;r, Chauh&#257;n and J&#257;don. But
fortune particularly smiled on Bh&#299;ka R&#257;thor, as his four sons, Mersi, Mult&#257;si, Dheda and Kh&#257;md&#257;r, great names among the <a id="d0e4948"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4948">167</a>]</span>Ch&#257;rans, rose immediately to eminence as commissariat transporters in the north. And not only under the Delhi Emperors, but
under the Sat&#257;ra, subsequently the Poona R&#257;j, and the Sub&#257;hship of the Niz&#257;m, did several of their descendants rise to consideration
and power.&#8221; It thus seems a reasonable hypothesis that the nucleus of the Banj&#257;ra caste was constituted by the Ch&#257;rans or
bards of R&#257;jput&#257;na. Mr. Bhimbhai Kirpar&#257;m<a id="d0e4950src" href="#d0e4950" class="noteref">14</a> also identifies the Ch&#257;rans and Banj&#257;ras, but I have not been able to find the exact passage. The following notice<a id="d0e4954src" href="#d0e4954" class="noteref">15</a> by Colonel Tone is of interest in this connection:

</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast consumption that attends a Mar&#257;tha army necessarily superinduces the idea of great supplies; yet, notwithstanding
this, the native powers never concern themselves about providing for their forces, and have no idea of a grain and victualling
department, which forms so great an object in a European campaign. The Banias or grain-sellers in an Indian army have always
their servants ahead of the troops on the line of march, to purchase in the circumjacent country whatever necessaries are
to be disposed of. Articles of consumption are never wanting in a native camp, though they are generally twenty-five per cent
dearer than in the town baz&#257;rs; but independent of this mode of supply the Vanj&#257;ris or itinerant grain-merchants furnish large
quantities, which they bring on bullocks from an immense distance. These are a very peculiar race, and appear a marked and
discriminated people from any other I have seen in this country. Formerly they were considered so sacred that they passed
in safety in the midst of contending armies; of late, however, this reverence for their character is much abated and they
have been frequently plundered, particularly by Tipu.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The reference to the sacred character attaching to the Banj&#257;ras a century ago appears to be strong evidence in favour of their
derivation from the Ch&#257;rans. For it could scarcely have been obtained by any body of commissariat agents coming into India
with the Muhammadans. <a id="d0e4965"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4965">168</a>]</span>The fact that the example of disregarding it was first set by a Muhammadan prince points to the same conclusion.

</p>
<p>Mr. Irvine notices the Banj&#257;ras with the Mughal armies in similar terms:<a id="d0e4969src" href="#d0e4969" class="noteref">16</a> &#8220;It is by these people that the Indian armies in the field are fed, and they are never injured by either army. The grain
is taken from them, but invariably paid for. They encamp for safety every evening in a regular square formed of the bags of
grain of which they construct a breastwork. They and their families are in the centre, and the oxen are made fast outside.
Guards with matchlocks and spears are placed at the corners, and their dogs do duty as advanced posts. I have seen them with
droves of 5000 bullocks. They do not move above two miles an hour, as their cattle are allowed to graze as they proceed on
the march.&#8221;

</p>
<p>One may suppose that the Ch&#257;rans having acted as carriers for the R&#257;jp&#363;t chiefs and courts, both in time of peace and in their
continuous intestinal feuds, were pressed into service when the Mughal armies entered R&#257;jput&#257;na and passed through it to Gujar&#257;t
and the Deccan. In adopting the profession of transport agents for the imperial troops they may have been amalgamated into
a fresh caste with other Hindus and Muhammadans doing the same work, just as the camp language formed by the superposition
of a Persian vocabulary on to a grammatical basis of Hindi became Urdu or Hindust&#257;ni. The readiness of the Ch&#257;rans to commit
suicide rather than give up property committed to their charge was not, however, copied by the Banj&#257;ras, and so far as I am
aware there is no record of men of this caste taking their own lives, though they had little scruple with those of others.

<div class="div2" id="d0e4976">
<h3>3. Ch&#257;ran Ranj&#257;rans employed with the Mughal armies.</h3>
<p>The Ch&#257;ran Banj&#257;ras, Mr. Cumberlege states,<a id="d0e4981src" href="#d0e4981" class="noteref">17</a> first came to the Deccan with Asaf Kh&#257;n in the campaign which closed with the annexation by the Emperor Sh&#257;h Jah&#257;n of Ahmadnagar
and Ber&#257;r about 1630. Their leaders or N&#257;iks were Bhangi and Jhangi of the R&#257;thor<a id="d0e4989src" href="#d0e4989" class="noteref">18</a> and <a id="d0e4992"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4992">169</a>]</span>Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s of the J&#257;don clan. Bhangi and Jhangi had 180,000 pack-bullocks, and Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s 52,000. It was naturally an object
with Asaf Kh&#257;n to keep his commissariat well up with his force, and as Bhangi and Jhangi made difficulties about the supply
of grass and water to their cattle, he gave them an order engraved on copper in letters of gold to the following effect:


</p>
<div class="poem" lang="und">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>Ranjan k&#257; p&#257;ni

</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Wah&#257;n Bhangi Jhangi ke bail,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which may be rendered as follows: &#8220;If you can find no water elsewhere you may even take it from the pots of my followers;
grass you may take from the roofs of their huts; and I will pardon you up to three murders a day, provided that wherever I
find my cavalry, Bhangi and Jhangi&#8217;s bullocks shall be with them.&#8221; This grant is still in the possession of Bhangi N&#257;ik&#8217;s
descendant who lives at Musi, near Hingoli. He is recognised by the Hyder&#257;b&#257;d Court as the head N&#257;ik of the Banj&#257;ra caste,
and on his death his successor receives a <i>khillat</i> or dress-of-honour from His Highness the Niz&#257;m. After Asaf Kh&#257;n&#8217;s campaign and settlement in the Deccan, a quarrel broke
out between the R&#257;thor clan, headed by Bhangi and Jhangi, and the J&#257;dons under Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s, owing to the fact that Asaf Kh&#257;n
had refused to give Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s a grant like that quoted above. Both Bhangi and Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s were slain in the feud and the
J&#257;dons captured the standard, consisting of eight <i>th&#257;ns</i> (lengths) of cloth, which was annually presented by the Niz&#257;m to Bhangi&#8217;s descendants. When Mr. Cumberlege wrote (1869),
this standard was in the possession of Hatti N&#257;ik, a descendant of Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s, who had an estate near Muchli Bunder, in the
Madras Presidency. Colonel Mackenzie states<a id="d0e5013src" href="#d0e5013" class="noteref">19</a> that the leaders of the R&#257;thor clan became so distinguished not only in their particular line but as men of war that the
Emperors recognised their carrying distinctive standards, which were known as <i>dhal</i> <a id="d0e5019"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5019">170</a>]</span>by the R&#257;thors themselves. Jhangi&#8217;s family was also represented in the person of R&#257;mu N&#257;ik, the <i>patel</i> or headman of the village of Yaoli in the Yeotm&#257;l District. In 1791&#8211;92 the Banj&#257;ras were employed to supply grain to the
British army under the Marquis of Cornwallis during the siege of Seringapatam,<a id="d0e5024src" href="#d0e5024" class="noteref">20</a> and the Duke of Wellington in his Indian campaigns regularly engaged them as part of the commissariat staff of his army.
On one occasion he said of them: &#8220;The Banj&#257;ras I look upon in the light of servants of the public, of whose grain I have a
right to regulate the sale, always taking care that they have a proportionate advantage.&#8221;<a id="d0e5030src" href="#d0e5030" class="noteref">21</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5036">
<h3>4. Internal structure.</h3>
<p>Mr. Cumberlege gives four main divisions of the caste in Ber&#257;r, the Ch&#257;rans, Mathurias, Labh&#257;nas and Dh&#257;ris. Of these the
Ch&#257;rans are by far the most numerous and important, and included all the famous leaders of the caste mentioned above. The
Ch&#257;rans are divided into the five clans, R&#257;thor, Panw&#257;r, Chauh&#257;n, Puri and J&#257;don or Burthia, all of these being the names
of leading R&#257;jp&#363;t clans; and as the Ch&#257;ran bards themselves were probably R&#257;jp&#363;ts, the Banj&#257;ras, who are descended from them,
may claim the same lineage. Each clan or sept is divided into a number of subsepts; thus among the R&#257;thors the principal subsept
is the Bhurkia, called after the Bh&#299;ka R&#257;thor already mentioned; and this is again split into four groups, Mersi, Mult&#257;si,
Dheda and Kh&#257;md&#257;r, named after his four sons. As a rule, members of the same clan, Panw&#257;r, R&#257;thor and so on, may not intermarry,
but Mr. Cumberlege states that a man belonging to the B&#257;nod or Bhurkia subsepts of the R&#257;thors must not take a wife from his
own subsept, but may marry any other R&#257;thor girl. It seems probable that the same rule may hold with the other subsepts, as
it is most unlikely that intermarriage should still be prohibited among so large a body as the R&#257;thor Ch&#257;rans have now become.
It may be supposed therefore that the division into subsepts took place when it became too inconvenient to prohibit marriage
<a id="d0e5041"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5041">171</a>]</span>throughout the whole body of the sept, as has happened in other cases. The Mathuria Banj&#257;ras take their name from Mathura
or Muttra and appear to be Br&#257;hmans. &#8220;They wear the sacred thread,<a id="d0e5043src" href="#d0e5043" class="noteref">22</a> know the <i>Gayatri Mantra</i>, and to the present day abstain from meat and liquor, subsisting entirely on grain and vegetables. They always had a sufficiency
of Ch&#257;rans and servants (<i>J&#257;ngar</i>) in their villages to perform all necessary manual labour, and would not themselves work for a remuneration otherwise than
by carrying grain, which was and still is their legitimate occupation; but it was not considered undignified to cut wood and
grass for the household. Both Mathuria and Labh&#257;na men are fairer than the Ch&#257;rans; they wear better jewellery and their loin-cloths
have a silk border, while those of the Ch&#257;rans are of rough, common cloth.&#8221; The Mathurias are sometimes known as Ahiw&#257;si,
and may be connected with the Ahiw&#257;sis of the Hindust&#257;ni Districts, who also drive pack-bullocks and call themselves Br&#257;hmans.
But it is naturally a sin for a Br&#257;hman to load the sacred ox, and any one who does so is held to have derogated from the
priestly order. The Mathurias are divided according to Mr. Cumberlege into four groups called P&#257;nde, Dube, T&#299;wari and Chaube,
all of which are common titles of Hindust&#257;ni Br&#257;hmans and signify a man learned in one, two, three and four Vedas respectively.
It is probable that these groups are exogamous, marrying with each other, but this is not stated. The third division, the
Labh&#257;nas, may derive their name from <i>lavana</i>, salt, and probably devoted themselves more especially to the carriage of this staple. They are said to be R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and to
be descended from Mota and Mola, the cowherds of Krishna. The fourth subdivision are the Dh&#257;ris or bards of the caste, who
rank below the others. According to their own story<a id="d0e5057src" href="#d0e5057" class="noteref">23</a> their ancestor was a member of the Bh&#257;t caste, who became a disciple of N&#257;nak, the Sikh apostle, and with him attended a
feast given by the Mughal Emperor Humayun. Here he ate the flesh of a cow or buffalo, and in consequence became a Muhammadan
and was circumcised. He was employed as a musician at the Mughal court, and his sons <a id="d0e5060"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5060">172</a>]</span>joined the Ch&#257;rans and became the bards of the Banj&#257;ra caste. &#8220;The Dh&#257;ris,&#8221; Mr. Cumberlege continues, &#8220;are both musicians
and mendicants; they sing in praise of their own and the Ch&#257;ran ancestors and of the old kings of Delhi; while at certain
seasons of the year they visit Ch&#257;ran hamlets, when each family gives them a young bullock or a few rupees. They are Muhammadans,
but worship S&#257;rasvati and at their marriages offer up a he-goat to G&#257;ji and Gandha, the two sons of the original Bh&#257;t, who
became a Muhammadan. At burials a Fak&#299;r is called to read the prayers.&#8221;

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5062">
<h3>5. Minor subcastes.</h3>
<p>Besides the above four main divisions, there are a number of others, the caste being now of a very mixed character. Two principal
Muhammadan groups are given by Sir H. Elliot, the T&#363;rkia and Mukeri. The T&#363;rkia have thirty-six septs, some with R&#257;jp&#363;t names
and others territorial or titular. They seem to be a mixed group of Hindus who may have embraced Islam as the religion of
their employers. The Mukeri Banj&#257;ras assert that they derive their name from Mecca (Makka), which one of their N&#257;iks, who
had his camp in the vicinity, assisted Father Abraham in building.<a id="d0e5067src" href="#d0e5067" class="noteref">24</a> Mr. Crooke thinks that the name may be a corruption of Makkeri and mean a seller of maize. Mr. Cumberlege says of them: &#8220;Mult&#257;nis
and Mukeris have been called Banj&#257;ras also, but have nothing in common with the caste; the Mult&#257;nis are carriers of grain
and the Mukeris of wood and timber, and hence the confusion may have arisen between them.&#8221; But they are now held to be Banj&#257;ras
by common usage; in Saugor the Mukeris also deal in cattle. From Ch&#257;nda a different set of subcastes is reported called Bh&#363;sarjin,
Ladjin, Saojin and Kanhejin; the first may take their name from <i>bh&#363;sa</i>, the chaff of wheat, while Lad is the term used for people coming from Gujar&#257;t, and Sao means a banker. In Sambalpur again
a class of Thuria Banj&#257;ras is found, divided into the Bandesia, Atharadesia, Navadesia and Chhadesia, or the men of the 52
districts, the 18 districts, the 9 districts and the 6 districts respectively. The first and last two of these take food and
marry with each other. Other groups are the Gu&#257;r Banj&#257;ras, apparently from Gu&#257;ra or Gw&#257;la, a milkman, the <a id="d0e5078"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5078">173</a>]</span>G&#363;guria Banj&#257;ras, who may, Mr. Hira L&#257;l suggests, take their name from trading in <i>g&#363;gar</i>, a kind of gum, and the Bahr&#363;p Banj&#257;ras, who are Nats or acrobats. In Ber&#257;r also a number of the caste have become respectable
cultivators and now call themselves Wanj&#257;ri, disclaiming any connection with the Banj&#257;ras, probably on account of the bad
reputation for crime attached to these latter. Many of the Wanj&#257;ris have been allowed to rank with the Kunbi caste, and call
themselves Wanj&#257;ri Kunbis in order the better to dissociate themselves from their parent caste. The existing caste is therefore
of a very mixed nature, and the original Br&#257;hman and Ch&#257;ran strains, though still perfectly recognisable, cannot have maintained
their purity.

<div class="div2" id="d0e5083">
<h3>6. Marriage: betrothal.</h3>
<p>At a betrothal in Nim&#257;r the bridegroom and his friends come and stay in the next village to that of the bride. The two parties
meet on the boundary of the village, and here the bride-price is fixed, which is often a very large sum, ranging from Rs.
200 to Rs. 1000. Until the price is paid the father will not let the bridegroom into his house. In Yeotm&#257;l, when a betrothal
is to be made, the parties go to a liquor-shop and there a betel-leaf and a large handful of sugar are distributed to everybody.
Here the price to be paid for the bride amounts to Rs. 40 and four young bullocks. Prior to the wedding the bridegroom goes
and stays for a month or so in the house of the bride&#8217;s father, and during this time he must provide a supply of liquor daily
for the bride&#8217;s male relatives. The period was formerly longer, but now extends to a month at the most. While he resides at
the bride&#8217;s house the bridegroom wears a cloth over his head so that his face cannot be seen. Probably the prohibition against
seeing him applies to the bride only, as the rule in Ber&#257;r is that between the betrothal and marriage of a Ch&#257;ran girl she
may not eat or drink in the bridegroom&#8217;s house, or show her face to him or any of his relatives. Mathuria girls must be wedded
before they are seven years old, but the Ch&#257;rans permit them to remain single until after adolescence.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5088">
<h3>7. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Banj&#257;ra marriages are frequently held in the rains, a season forbidden to other Hindus, but naturally the most convenient
to them, because in the dry weather they are usually <a id="d0e5093"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5093">174</a>]</span>travelling. For the marriage ceremony they pitch a tent in lieu of the marriage-shed, and on the ground they place two rice-pounding
pestles, round which the bride and bridegroom make the seven turns. Others substitute for the pestles a pack-saddle with two
bags of grain in order to symbolise their camp life. During the turns the girl&#8217;s hand is held by the Joshi or village priest,
or some other Br&#257;hman, in case she should fall; such an occurrence being probably a very unlucky omen. Afterwards, the girl
runs away and the Br&#257;hman has to pursue and catch her. In Bhand&#257;ra the girl is clad only in a light skirt and breast-cloth,
and her body is rubbed all over with oil in order to make his task more difficult. During this time the bride&#8217;s party pelt
the Br&#257;hman with rice, turmeric and areca-nuts, and sometimes even with stones; and if he is forced to cry with the pain,
it is considered lucky. But if he finally catches the girl, he is conducted to a dais and sits there holding a brass plate
in front of him, into which the bridegroom&#8217;s party drop presents. A case is mentioned of a Br&#257;hman having obtained Rs. 70
in this manner. Among the Mathuria Banj&#257;ras of Ber&#257;r the ceremony resembles the usual Hindu type.<a id="d0e5095src" href="#d0e5095" class="noteref">25</a> Before the wedding the families bring the branches of eight or ten different kinds of trees, and perform the <i>hom</i> or fire sacrifice with them. A Br&#257;hman knots the clothes of the couple together, and they walk round the fire. When the bride
arrives at the bridegroom&#8217;s hamlet after the wedding, two small brass vessels are given to her; she fetches water in these
and returns them to the women of the boy&#8217;s family, who mix this with other water previously drawn, and the girl, who up to
this period was considered of no caste at all, becomes a Mathuria.<a id="d0e5101src" href="#d0e5101" class="noteref">26</a> Food is cooked with this water, and the bride and bridegroom are formally received into the husband&#8217;s <i>kuri</i> or hamlet. It is possible that the mixing of the water may be a survival of the blood covenant, whereby a girl was received
into her husband&#8217;s clan on her marriage by her blood being mixed with that of her husband.<a id="d0e5109src" href="#d0e5109" class="noteref">27</a> Or it may be simply symbolical of the union of the families. In some localities after the wedding the bride and bridegroom
are made to <a id="d0e5112"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5112">175</a>]</span>stand on two bullocks, which are driven forward, and it is believed that whichever of them falls off first will be the first
to die.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5114">
<h3>8. Widow remarriage.</h3>
<p>Owing to the scarcity of women in the caste a widow is seldom allowed to go out of the family, and when her husband dies she
is taken either by his elder or younger brother; this is in opposition to the usual Hindu practice, which forbids the marriage
of a woman to her deceased husband&#8217;s elder brother, on the ground that as successor to the headship of the joint family he
stands to her, at least potentially, in the light of a father. If the widow prefers another man and runs away to him, the
first husband&#8217;s relatives claim compensation, and threaten, in the event of its being refused, to abduct a girl from this
man&#8217;s family in exchange for the widow. But no case of abduction has occurred in recent years. In Ber&#257;r the compensation claimed
in the case of a woman marrying out of the family amounts to Rs. 75, with Rs. 5 for the N&#257;ik or headman of the family. Should
the widow elope without her brother-in-law&#8217;s consent, he chooses ten or twelve of his friends to go and sit <i>dharna</i> (starving themselves) before the hut of the man who has taken her. He is then bound to supply these men with food and liquor
until he has paid the customary sum, when he may marry the widow.<a id="d0e5122src" href="#d0e5122" class="noteref">28</a> In the event of the second husband being too poor to pay monetary compensation, he gives a goat, which is cut into eighteen
pieces and distributed to the community.<a id="d0e5125src" href="#d0e5125" class="noteref">29</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5131">
<h3>9. Birth and death.</h3>
<p>After the birth of a child the mother is unclean for five days, and lives apart in a separate hut, which is run up for her
use in the <i>kuri</i> or hamlet. On the sixth day she washes the feet of all the children in the <i>kuri</i>, feeds them and then returns to her husband&#8217;s hut. When a child is born in a moving <i>t&#257;nda</i> or camp, the same rule is observed, and for five days the mother walks alone after the camp during the daily march. The caste
bury the bodies of unmarried <a id="d0e5145"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5145">176</a>]</span>persons and those dying of smallpox and burn the others. Their rites of mourning are not strict, and are observed only for
three days. The Banj&#257;ras have a saying: &#8220;Death in a foreign land is to be preferred, where there are no kinsfolk to mourn,
and the corpse is a feast for birds and animals&#8221;; but this may perhaps be taken rather as an expression of philosophic resignation
to the fate which must be in store for many of them, than a real preference, as with most people the desire to die at home
almost amounts to an instinct.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5147">
<h3>10. Religion: Banj&#257;ri Devi.</h3>
<p>One of the tutelary deities of the Banj&#257;ras is Banj&#257;ri Devi, whose shrine is usually located in the forest. It is often represented
by a heap of stones, a large stone smeared with vermilion being placed on the top of the heap to represent the goddess. When
a Banj&#257;ra passes the place he casts a stone upon the heap as a prayer to the goddess to protect him from the dangers of the
forest. A similar practice of offering bells from the necks of cattle is recorded by Mr. Thurston:<a id="d0e5152src" href="#d0e5152" class="noteref">30</a> &#8220;It is related by Moor that he passed a tree on which were hanging several hundred bells. This was a superstitious sacrifice
of the Banj&#257;ras (Lamb&#257;ris), who, passing this tree, are in the habit of hanging a bell or bells upon it, which they take from
the necks of their sick cattle, expecting to leave behind them the complaint also. Our servants particularly cautioned us
against touching these diabolical bells, but as a few of them were taken for our own cattle, several accidents which happened
were imputed to the anger of the deity to whom these offerings were made; who, they say, inflicts the same disorder on the
unhappy bullock who carries a bell from the tree, as that from which he relieved the donor.&#8221; In their houses the Banj&#257;ri Devi
is represented by a pack-saddle set on high in the room, and this is worshipped before the caravans set out on their annual
tours.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5160">
<h3>11. M&#299;thu Bh&#363;kia.</h3>
<p>Another deity is M&#299;thu Bh&#363;kia, an old freebooter, who lived in the Central Provinces; he is venerated by the dacoits as the
most clever dacoit known in the annals of the caste, and a hut was usually set apart for him in each <a id="d0e5165"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5165">177</a>]</span>hamlet, a staff carrying a white flag being planted before it. Before setting out for a dacoity, the men engaged would assemble
at the hut of M&#299;thu Bh&#363;kia, and, burning a lamp before him, ask for an omen; if the wick of the lamp drooped the omen was
propitious, and the men present then set out at once on the raid without returning home. They might not speak to each other
nor answer if challenged; for if any one spoke the charm would be broken and the protection of M&#299;thu Bh&#363;kia removed; and they
should either return to take the omens again or give up that particular dacoity altogether.<a id="d0e5167src" href="#d0e5167" class="noteref">31</a> It has been recorded as a characteristic trait of Banj&#257;ras that they will, as a rule, not answer if spoken to when engaged
on a robbery, and the custom probably arises from this observance; but the worship of M&#299;thu Bh&#363;kia is now frequently neglected.
After a successful dacoity a portion of the spoil would be set apart for M&#299;thu Bh&#363;kia, and of the balance the N&#257;ik or headman
of the village received two shares if he participated in the crime; the man who struck the first blow or did most towards
the common object also received two shares, and all the rest one share. With M&#299;thu Bh&#363;kia&#8217;s share a feast was given at which
thanks were returned to him for the success of the enterprise, a burnt offering of incense being made in his tent and a libation
of liquor poured over the flagstaff. A portion of the food was sent to the women and children, and the men sat down to the
feast. Women were not allowed to share in the worship of M&#299;thu Bh&#363;kia nor to enter his hut.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5170">
<h3>12. Siva Bh&#257;ia.</h3>
<p>Another favourite deity is Siva Bh&#257;ia, whose story is given by Colonel Mackenzie<a id="d0e5175src" href="#d0e5175" class="noteref">32</a> as follows: &#8220;The love borne by M&#257;ri M&#257;ta, the goddess of cholera, for the handsome Siva R&#257;thor, is an event of our own times
(1874); she proposed to him, but his heart being pre-engaged he rejected her; and in consequence his earthly bride was smitten
sick and died, and the hand of the goddess fell heavily on Siva himself, thwarting all his schemes and blighting his fortunes
and possessions, until at last he gave himself up to her. She then possessed him and caused him to prosper exceedingly, gifting
him with supernatural power until his fame was <a id="d0e5180"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5180">178</a>]</span>noised abroad, and he was venerated as the saintly Siva Bh&#257;ia or great brother to all women, being himself unable to marry.
But in his old age the goddess capriciously wished him to marry and have issue, but he refused and was slain and buried at
Pohur in Ber&#257;r. A temple was erected over him and his kinsmen became priests of it, and hither large numbers are attracted
by the supposed efficacy of vows made to Siva, the most sacred of all oaths being that taken in his name.&#8221; If a Banj&#257;ra swears
by Siva Bh&#257;ia, placing his right hand on the bare head of his son and heir, and grasping a cow&#8217;s tail in his left, he will
fear to perjure himself, lest by doing so he should bring injury on his son and a murrain on his cattle.<a id="d0e5182src" href="#d0e5182" class="noteref">33</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5185">
<h3>13. Worship of cattle.</h3>
<p>Naturally also the Banj&#257;ras worshipped their pack-cattle.<a id="d0e5190src" href="#d0e5190" class="noteref">34</a> &#8220;When sickness occurs they lead the sick man to the feet of the bullock called H&#257;tadiya.<a id="d0e5199src" href="#d0e5199" class="noteref">35</a> On this animal no burden is ever laid, but he is decorated with streamers of red-dyed silk, and tinkling bells with many
brass chains and rings on neck and feet, and silken tassels hanging in all directions; he moves steadily at the head of the
convoy, and at the place where he lies down when he is tired they pitch their camp for the day; at his feet they make their
vows when difficulties overtake them, and in illness, whether of themselves or their cattle, they trust to his worship for
a cure.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5202">
<h3>14. Connection with the Sikhs.</h3>
<p>Mr. Balfour also mentions in his paper that the Banj&#257;ras call themselves Sikhs, and it is noticeable that the Ch&#257;ran subcaste
say that their ancestors were three R&#257;jp&#363;t boys who followed Guru N&#257;nak, the prophet of the Sikhs. The influence of N&#257;nak
appears to have been widely extended over northern India, and to have been felt by large bodies of the people other than those
who actually embraced the Sikh religion. Cumberlege states<a id="d0e5207src" href="#d0e5207" class="noteref">36</a> that before starting to his marriage the bridegroom ties a rupee in his turban in honour of Guru N&#257;nak, which is afterwards
expended in sweetmeats. <a id="d0e5212"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5212">179</a>]</span>But otherwise the modern Banj&#257;ras do not appear to retain any Sikh observances.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5214">
<h3>15. Witchcraft.</h3>
<p>&#8220;The Banj&#257;ras,&#8221; Sir A. Lyall writes,<a id="d0e5219src" href="#d0e5219" class="noteref">37</a> &#8220;are terribly vexed by witchcraft, to which their wandering and precarious existence especially exposes them in the shape
of fever, rheumatism and dysentery. Solemn inquiries are still held in the wild jungles where these people camp out like gipsies,
and many an unlucky hag has been strangled by sentence of their secret tribunals.&#8221; The business of magic and witchcraft was
in the hands of two classes of Bhagats or magicians, one good and the other bad,<a id="d0e5224src" href="#d0e5224" class="noteref">38</a> who may correspond to the European practitioners of black and white magic. The good Bhagat is called Nimbu-k&#257;tna or lemon-cutter,
a lemon speared on a knife being a powerful averter of evil spirits. He is a total abstainer from meat and liquor, and fasts
once a week on the day sacred to the deity whom he venerates, usually Mah&#257;deo; he is highly respected and never panders to
vice. But the J&#257;nta, the &#8216;Wise or Cunning Man,&#8217; is of a different type, and the following is an account of the devilry often
enacted when a deputation visited him to inquire into the cause of a prolonged illness, a cattle murrain, a sudden death or
other misfortune. A woman might often be called a D&#257;kun or witch in spite, and when once this word had been used, the husband
or nearest male relative would be regularly bullied into consulting the J&#257;nta. Or if some woman had been ill for a week, an
avaricious<a id="d0e5233src" href="#d0e5233" class="noteref">39</a> husband or brother would begin to whisper foul play. Witchcraft would be mentioned, and the wise man called in. He would
give the sufferer a quid of betel, muttering an incantation, but this rarely effected a cure, as it was against the interest
of all parties that it should do so. The sufferer&#8217;s relatives would then go to their N&#257;ik, tell him that the sick person was
bewitched, and ask him to send a deputation to the J&#257;nta or witch-doctor. This would be at once despatched, consisting of
one male adult from each house in the hamlet, with one of the sufferer&#8217;s relatives. On the road the party would bury a bone
or other article to <a id="d0e5236"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5236">180</a>]</span>test the wisdom of the witch-doctor. But he was not to be caught out, and on their arrival he would bid the deputation rest,
and come to him for consultation on the following day. Meanwhile during the night the J&#257;nta would be thoroughly coached by
some accomplice in the party. Next morning, meeting the deputation, he would tell every man all particulars of his name and
family; name the invalid, and tell the party to bring materials for consulting the spirits, such as oil, vermilion, sugar,
dates, cocoanut, <i>chironji</i>,<a id="d0e5241src" href="#d0e5241" class="noteref">40</a> and sesamum. In the evening, holding a lamp, the J&#257;nta would be possessed by M&#257;riai, the goddess of cholera; he would mention
all particulars of the sick man&#8217;s illness, and indignantly inquire why they had buried the bone on the road, naming it and
describing the place. If this did not satisfy the deputation, a goat would be brought, and he would name its sex with any
distinguishing marks on the body. The sick person&#8217;s representative would then produce his <i>nazar</i> or fee, formerly Rs. 25, but lately the double of this or more. The J&#257;nta would now begin a sort of chant, introducing the
names of the families of the <i>kuri</i> other than that containing her who was to be proclaimed a witch, and heap on them all kinds of abuse. Finally, he would assume
an ironic tone, extol the virtues of a certain family, become facetious, and praise its representative then present. This
man would then question the J&#257;nta on all points regarding his own family, his connections, worldly goods, and what gods he
worshipped, ask who was the witch, who taught her sorcery, and how and why she practised it in this particular instance. But
the witch-doctor, having taken care to be well coached, would answer everything correctly and fix the guilt on to the witch.
A goat would be sacrificed and eaten with liquor, and the deputation would return. The punishment for being proclaimed a D&#257;kun
or witch was formerly death to the woman and a fine to be paid by her relatives to the bewitched person&#8217;s family. The woman&#8217;s
husband or her sons would be directed to kill her, and if they refused, other men were deputed to murder her, and bury the
body at once with all the clothing and ornaments then on her person, while a further fine would be exacted from the family
for not doing away with her themselves. <a id="d0e5253"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5253">181</a>]</span>But murder for witchcraft has been almost entirely stopped, and nowadays the husband, after being fined a few head of cattle,
which are given to the sick man, is turned out of the village with his wife. It is quite possible, however, that an obnoxious
old hag would even now not escape death, especially if the money fine were not forthcoming, and an instance is known in recent
times of a mother being murdered by her three sons. The whole village combined to screen these amiable young men, and eventually
they made the J&#257;nta the scapegoat, and he got seven years, while the murderers could not be touched. Colonel Mackenzie writes
that, &#8220;Curious to relate, the J&#257;ntas, known locally as Bhagats, in order to become possessed of their alleged powers of divination
and prophecy, require to travel to Kazhe, beyond Surat, there to learn and be instructed by low-caste Koli impostors.&#8221; This
is interesting as an instance of the powers of witchcraft being attributed by the Hindus or higher race to the indigenous
primitive tribes, a rule which Dr. Tylor and Dr. Jevons consider to hold good generally in the history of magic.

<h3>16. Human sacrifice.</h3>
<p>Several instances are known also of the Banj&#257;ras having practised human sacrifice. Mr. Thurston states:<a id="d0e5260src" href="#d0e5260" class="noteref">41</a> &#8220;In former times the Lamb&#257;dis, before setting out on a journey, used to procure a little child and bury it in the ground
up to the shoulders, and then drive their loaded bullocks over the unfortunate victim. In proportion to the bullocks thoroughly
trampling the child to death, so their belief in a successful journey increased.&#8221; The Abb&eacute; Dubois describes another form of
sacrifice:<a id="d0e5268src" href="#d0e5268" class="noteref">42</a>

</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lamb&#257;dis are accused of the still more atrocious crime of offering up human sacrifices. When they wish to perform this
horrible act, it is said, they secretly carry off the first person they meet. Having conducted the victim to some lonely spot,
they dig a hole in which they bury him up to the neck. While he is still alive they make a sort of lamp of dough made of flour,
which they place on his head; this they fill with oil, and light four wicks in it. Having done this, the men and women join
hands and, forming a <a id="d0e5275"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5275">182</a>]</span>circle, dance round their victim, singing and making a great noise until he expires.&#8221; Mr. Cumberlege records<a id="d0e5277src" href="#d0e5277" class="noteref">43</a> the following statement of a child kidnapped by a Banj&#257;ra caravan in 1871. After explaining how he was kidnapped and the
tip of his tongue cut off to give him a defect in speech, the Kunbi lad, taken from S&#257;hungarhi, in the Bhand&#257;ra District,
went on to say that, &#8220;The <i>t&#257;nda</i> (caravan) encamped for the night in the jungle. In the morning a woman named Gangi said that the devil was in her and that
a sacrifice must be made. On this four men and three women took a boy to a place they had made for <i>p&#363;ja</i> (worship). They fed him with milk, rice and sugar, and then made him stand up, when Gangi drew a sword and approached the
child, who tried to run away; caught and brought back to this place, Gangi, holding the sword with both hands and standing
on the child&#8217;s right side, cut off his head with one blow. Gangi collected the blood and sprinkled it on the idol; this idol
is made of stone, is about 9 inches high, and has something sparkling in its forehead. The camp marched that day, and for
four or five days consecutively, without another sacrifice; but on the fifth day a young woman came to the camp to sell curds,
and having bought some, the Banj&#257;ras asked her to come in in the evening and eat with them. She did come, and after eating
with the women slept in the camp. Early next morning she was sacrificed in the same way as the boy had been, but it took three
blows to cut off her head; it was done by Gangi, and the blood was sprinkled on the stone idol. About a month ago Sit&#257;r&#257;m,
a Gond lad, who had also been kidnapped and was in the camp, told me to run away as it had been decided to offer me up in
sacrifice at the next Jiuti festival, so I ran away.&#8221; The child having been brought to the police, a searching and protracted
inquiry was held, which, however, determined nothing, though it did not disprove his story.

<h3>17. Admission of outsiders: kidnapped children and slaves.</h3>
<p>The Banj&#257;ra caste is not closed to outsiders, but the general rule is to admit only women who have been married to Banj&#257;ra
men. Women of the lowest and impure castes are excluded, and for some unknown reason the Patwas<a id="d0e5293src" href="#d0e5293" class="noteref">44</a> and <a id="d0e5296"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5296">183</a>]</span>Nunias are bracketed with these. In Nim&#257;r it is stated that formerly Gonds, Korkus and even Bal&#257;his<a id="d0e5298src" href="#d0e5298" class="noteref">45</a> might become Banj&#257;ras, but this does not happen now, because the caste has lost its occupation of carrying goods, and there
is therefore no inducement to enter it. In former times they were much addicted to kidnapping children&#8212;these were whipped
up or enticed away whenever an opportunity presented itself during their expeditions. The children were first put into the
<i>gonis</i> or grain bags of the bullocks and so carried for a few days, being made over at each halt to the care of a woman, who would
pop the child back into its bag if any stranger passed by the encampment. The tongues of boys were sometimes slit or branded
with hot gold, this last being the ceremony of initiation into the caste still used in Nim&#257;r. Girls, if they were as old as
seven, were sometimes disfigured for fear of recognition, and for this purpose the juice of the marking-nut<a id="d0e5304src" href="#d0e5304" class="noteref">46</a> tree would be smeared on one side of the face, which burned into the skin and entirely altered the appearance. Such children
were known as J&#257;ngar. Girls would be used as concubines and servants of the married wife, and boys would also be employed
as servants. J&#257;ngar boys would be married to J&#257;ngar girls, both remaining in their condition of servitude. But sometimes the
more enterprising of them would abscond and settle down in a village. The rule was that for seven generations the children
of J&#257;ngars or slaves continued in that condition, after which they were recognised as proper Banj&#257;ras. The J&#257;ngar could not
draw in smoke through the stem of the huqqa when it was passed round in the assembly, but must take off the stem and inhale
from the bowl. The J&#257;ngar also could not eat off the bell-metal plates of his master, because these were liable to pollution,
but must use brass plates. At one time the Banj&#257;ras conducted a regular traffic in female slaves between Gujar&#257;t and Central
India, selling in each country the girls whom they had kidnapped in the other.<a id="d0e5308src" href="#d0e5308" class="noteref">47</a>

<h3>18. Dress.</h3>
<p>Up to twelve years of age a Ch&#257;ran girl only wears a skirt with a shoulder-cloth tucked into the waist and carried over the
left arm and the head. After this she may have anklets and bangles on the forearm and a breast-cloth. But until she is married
she may not have the <i>w&#257;nkri</i> or curved anklet, which marks that estate, nor wear bone or ivory bangles on the upper arm.<a id="d0e5330src" href="#d0e5330" class="noteref">48</a> When she is ten years old a Labh&#257;na girl is given two small bundles containing a nut, some cowries and rice, which are knotted
to two corners of the <i>dupatta</i> or shoulder-cloth and hung over the shoulder, one in front and one behind. This denotes maidenhood. The bundles are considered
sacred, are always knotted to the shoulder-cloth in wear, and are only removed to be tucked into the waist at the girl&#8217;s marriage,
where they are worn till death. These bundles alone distinguish the Labh&#257;na from the Mathuria woman. Women often have their
hair hanging down beside the face in front and woven behind with silver thread into a plait down the back. This is known as
Anthi, and has a number of cowries at the end. They have large bell-shaped ornaments of silver tied over the head and hanging
down behind the ears, the hollow part of the ornament being stuffed with sheep&#8217;s wool dyed red; and to these are attached
little bells, while the anklets on the feet are also hollow and contain little stones or balls, which tinkle as they move.
They have skirts, and separate short cloths drawn across the shoulders according to the northern fashion, usually red or green
in colour, and along the skirt-borders double lines of cowries are sewn. Their breast-cloths are profusely ornamented with
needle-work embroidery and small pieces of glass sewn into them, and are tied behind with cords of many colours whose ends
are decorated with cowries and beads. Strings of beads, ten to twenty thick, threaded on horse-hair, are worn round the neck.
Their favourite ornaments are cowries,<a id="d0e5336src" href="#d0e5336" class="noteref">49</a> and they <a id="d0e5339"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5339">185</a>]</span>have these on their dress, in their houses and on the trappings of their bullocks. On the arms they have ten or twelve bangles
of ivory, or in default of this lac, horn or cocoanut-shell. Mr. Ball states that he was &#8220;at once struck by the peculiar costumes
and brilliant clothing of these Indian gipsies. They recalled to my mind the appearance of the gipsies of the Lower Danube
and Wallachia.&#8221;<a id="d0e5341src" href="#d0e5341" class="noteref">50</a> The most distinctive ornament of a Banj&#257;ra married woman is, however, a small stick about 6 inches long made of the wood
of the <i>khair</i> or catechu. In Nim&#257;r this is given to a woman by her husband at marriage, and she wears it afterwards placed upright on the
top of the head, the hair being wound round it and the head-cloth draped over it in a graceful fashion. Widows leave it off,
but on remarriage adopt it again. The stick is known as <i>chunda</i> by the Banj&#257;ras, but outsiders call it <i>singh</i> or horn. In Yeotm&#257;l, instead of one, the women have two little sticks fixed upright in the hair. The rank of the woman is
said to be shown by the angle at which she wears this horn.<a id="d0e5355src" href="#d0e5355" class="noteref">51</a> The dress of the men presents no features of special interest. In Nim&#257;r they usually have a necklace of coral beads, and
some of them carry, slung on a thread round the neck, a <a id="d0e5364"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5364">186</a>]</span>tin tooth-pick and ear-scraper, while a small mirror and comb are kept in the head-cloth so that their toilet can be performed
anywhere.

</p>
<p>Mr. Cumberlege<a id="d0e5368src" href="#d0e5368" class="noteref">52</a> notes that in former times all Ch&#257;ran Banj&#257;ras when carrying grain for an army placed a twig of some tree, the sacred <i>n&#299;m</i><a id="d0e5375src" href="#d0e5375" class="noteref">53</a> when available, in their turban to show that they were on the war-path; and that they would do the same now if they had occasion
to fight to the death on any social matter or under any supposed grievance.

<div class="div2" id="d0e5379">
<h3>19. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The Banj&#257;ras eat all kinds of meat, including fowls and pork, and drink liquor. But the Mathurias abstain from both flesh
and liquor. Major Gunthorpe states that the Banj&#257;ras are accustomed to drink before setting out for a dacoity or robbery and,
as they smoke after drinking, the remains of leaf-pipes lying about the scene of action may indicate their handiwork. They
rank below the cultivating castes, and Br&#257;hmans will not take water to drink from them. When engaged in the carrying trade,
they usually lived in <i>kuris</i> or hamlets attached to such regular villages as had considerable tracts of waste land belonging to them. When the <i>t&#257;nda</i> or caravan started on its long carrying trips, the young men and some of the women went with it with the working bullocks,
while the old men and the remainder of the women and children remained to tend the breeding cattle in the hamlet. In Nim&#257;r
they generally rented a little land in the village to give them a footing, and paid also a carrying fee on the number of cattle
present. Their spare time was constantly occupied in the manufacture of hempen twine and sacking, which was much superior
to that obtainable in towns. Even in Captain Forsyth&#8217;s<a id="d0e5390src" href="#d0e5390" class="noteref">54</a> time (1866) the construction of railways and roads had seriously interfered with the Banjaras&#8217; calling, and they had perforce
taken to agriculture. Many of them have settled in the new ryotw&#257;ri villages in Nim&#257;r as Government tenants. They still grow
<i>tilli</i><a id="d0e5398src" href="#d0e5398" class="noteref">55</a> in preference to other crops, because this oilseed can be raised without much labour or skill, and during their former nomadic
life they were accustomed to <a id="d0e5402"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5402">187</a>]</span>sow it on any poor strip of land which they might rent for a season. Some of them also are accustomed to leave a part of their
holding untilled in memory of their former and more prosperous life. In many villages they have not yet built proper houses,
but continue to live in mud huts thatched with grass. They consider it unlucky to inhabit a house with a cement or tiled roof;
this being no doubt a superstition arising from their camp life. Their houses must also be built so that the main beams do
not cross, that is, the main beam of a house must never be in such a position that if projected it would cut another main
beam; but the beams may be parallel. The same rule probably governed the arrangement of tents in their camps. In Nim&#257;r they
prefer to live at some distance from water, probably that is of a tank or river; and this seems to be a survival of a usage
mentioned by the Abb&eacute; Dubois:<a id="d0e5404src" href="#d0e5404" class="noteref">56</a> &#8220;Among other curious customs of this odious caste is one that obliges them to drink no water which is not drawn from springs
or wells. The water from rivers and tanks being thus forbidden, they are obliged in case of necessity to dig a little hole
by the side of a tank or river and take the water filtering through, which, by this means, is supposed to become spring water.&#8221;
It is possible that this rule may have had its origin in a sanitary precaution. Colonel Sleeman notes<a id="d0e5409src" href="#d0e5409" class="noteref">57</a> that the Banj&#257;ras on their carrying trips preferred by-paths through jungles to the high roads along cultivated plains, as
grass, wood and water were more abundant along such paths; and when they could not avoid the high roads, they commonly encamped
as far as they could from villages and towns, and upon the banks of rivers and streams, with the same object of obtaining
a sufficient supply of grass, wood and water. Now it is well known that the decaying vegetation in these hill streams renders
the water noxious and highly productive of malaria. And it seems possible that the perception of this fact led the Banj&#257;ras
to dig shallow wells by the sides of the streams for their drinking-water, so that the supply thus obtained might be in some
degree filtered by percolation through the <a id="d0e5414"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5414">188</a>]</span>intervening soil and freed from its vegetable germs. And the custom may have grown into a taboo, its underlying reason being
unknown to the bulk of them, and be still practised, though no longer necessary when they do not travel. If this explanation
be correct it would be an interesting conclusion that the Banj&#257;ras anticipated so far as they were able the sanitary precaution
by which our soldiers are supplied with portable filters when on the march.

<h3>20. The N&#257;ik or headman. Banj&#257;ra dogs.</h3>
<p>Each <i>kuri</i> (hamlet) or <i>t&#257;nda</i> (caravan) had a chief or leader with the designation of N&#257;ik, a Telugu word meaning &#8216;lord&#8217; or &#8216;master.&#8217; The office of N&#257;ik<a id="d0e5431src" href="#d0e5431" class="noteref">58</a> was only partly hereditary, and the choice also depended on ability. The N&#257;ik had authority to decide all disputes in the
community, and the only appeal from him lay to the representatives of Bhangi and Jhangi N&#257;ik&#8217;s families at Narsi and Poona,
and to Burthia N&#257;ik&#8217;s successors in the Telugu country. As already seen, the N&#257;ik received two shares if he participated in
a robbery or other crime, and a fee on the remarriage of a widow outside her family and on the discovery of a witch. Another
matter in which he was specially interested was pig-sticking. The Banj&#257;ras have a particular breed of dogs, and with these
they were accustomed to hunt wild pig on foot, carrying spears. When a pig was killed, the head was cut off and presented
to the N&#257;ik or headman, and if any man was injured or gored by the pig in the hunt, the N&#257;ik kept and fed him without charge
until he recovered.

</p>
<p>The following notice of the Banj&#257;ras and their dogs may be reproduced:<a id="d0e5436src" href="#d0e5436" class="noteref">59</a> &#8220;They are brave and have the reputation of great independence, which I am not disposed to allow to them. The Wanj&#257;ri indeed
is insolent on the road, and will drive his bullocks up against a Sahib or any one else; but at any disadvantage he is abject
enough. I remember one who rather enjoyed seeing his dogs attack me, whom he supposed alone and unarmed, but the sight of
a cocked pistol made him very quick in calling them off, and very humble in praying for their lives, which I spared <a id="d0e5442"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5442">189</a>]</span>less for his entreaties than because they were really noble animals. The Wanj&#257;ris are famous for their dogs, of which there
are three breeds. The first is a large, smooth dog, generally black, sometimes fawn-coloured, with a square heavy head, most
resembling the Danish boarhound. This is the true Wanj&#257;ri dog. The second is also a large, square-headed dog, but shaggy,
more like a great underbred spaniel than anything else. The third is an almost tailless greyhound, of the type known all over
India by the various names of L&#257;t, Polygar, R&#257;mp&#363;ri, etc. They all run both by sight and scent, and with their help the Wanj&#257;ris
kill a good deal of game, chiefly pigs; but I think they usually keep clear of the old fighting boars. Besides sport and their
legitimate occupations the Wanj&#257;ris seldom stickle at supplementing their resources by theft, especially of cattle; and they
are more than suspected of infanticide.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The Banj&#257;ras are credited with great affection for their dogs, and the following legend is told about one of them: Once upon
a time a Banj&#257;ra, who had a faithful dog, took a loan from a Bania (moneylender) and pledged his dog with him as security
for payment. And some time afterwards, while the dog was with the moneylender, a theft was committed in his house, and the
dog followed the thieves and saw them throw the property into a tank. When they went away the dog brought the Bania to the
tank and he found his property. He was therefore very pleased with the dog and wrote a letter to his master, saying that the
loan was repaid, and tied it round his neck and said to him, &#8216;Now, go back to your master.&#8217; So the dog started back, but on
his way he met his master, the Banj&#257;ra, coming to the Bania with the money for the repayment of the loan. And when the Banj&#257;ra
saw the dog he was angry with him, not seeing the letter, and thinking he had run away, and said to him, &#8216;Why did you come,
betraying your trust?&#8217; and he killed the dog in a rage. And after killing him he found the letter and was very grieved, so
he built a temple to the dog&#8217;s memory, which is called the Kukurra Mandhi. And in the temple is the image of a dog. This temple
is in the Dr&#363;g District, five miles from <a id="d0e5446"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5446">190</a>]</span>B&#257;lod. A similar story is told of the temple of Kukurra Math in Mandla.

<h3>21. Criminal tendencies of the caste.</h3>
<p>The following notice of Banj&#257;ra criminals is abstracted from Major Gunthorpe&#8217;s interesting account:<a id="d0e5453src" href="#d0e5453" class="noteref">60</a> &#8220;In the palmy days of the tribe dacoities were undertaken on the most extensive scale. Gangs of fifty to a hundred and fifty
well-armed men would go long distances from their <i>t&#257;ndas</i> or encampments for the purpose of attacking houses in villages, or treasure-parties or wealthy travellers on the high roads.
The more intimate knowledge which the police have obtained concerning the habits of this race, and the detection and punishment
of many criminals through approvers, have aided in stopping the heavy class of dacoities formerly prevalent, and their operations
are now on a much smaller scale. In British territory arms are scarcely carried, but each man has a good stout stick (<i>gedi</i>), the bark of which is peeled off so as to make it look whitish and fresh. The attack is generally commenced by stone-throwing
and then a rush is made, the sticks being freely used and the victims almost invariably struck about the head or face. While
plundering, Hindust&#257;ni is sometimes spoken, but as a rule they never utter a word, but grunt signals to one another. Their
loin-cloths are braced up, nothing is worn on the upper part of the body, and their faces are generally muffled. In house
dacoities men are posted at different corners of streets, each with a supply of well-chosen round stones to keep off any people
coming to the rescue. Banj&#257;ras are very expert cattle-lifters, sometimes taking as many as a hundred head or even more at
a time. This kind of robbery is usually practised in hilly or forest country where the cattle are sent to graze. Secreting
themselves they watch for the herdsman to have his usual midday doze and for the cattle to stray to a little distance. As
many as possible are then driven off to a great distance and secreted in ravines and woods. If questioned they answer that
the animals belong to landowners and have been given into their charge to graze, and as this is done every day the questioner
thinks nothing more of it. After a time the cattle are <a id="d0e5464"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5464">191</a>]</span>quietly sold to individual purchasers or taken to markets at a distance.<span id="d0e5466" class="corr" title="Source: ">&#8221;</span>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5469">
<h3>22. Their virtues.</h3>
<p>The Banj&#257;ras, however, are far from being wholly criminal, and the number who have adopted an honest mode of livelihood is
continually on the increase. Some allowance must be made for their having been deprived of their former calling by the cessation
of the continual wars which distracted India under native rule, and the extension of roads and railways which has rendered
their mode of transport by pack-bullocks almost entirely obsolete. At one time practically all the grain exported from Chhatt&#299;sgarh
was carried by them. In 1881 Mr. Kitts noted that the number of Banj&#257;ras convicted in the Ber&#257;r criminal courts was lower
in proportion to the strength of the caste than that of Muhammadans, Br&#257;hmans, Koshtis or Sunars,<a id="d0e5474src" href="#d0e5474" class="noteref">61</a> though the offences committed by them were usually more heinous. Colonel Mackenzie had quite a favourable opinion of them:
&#8220;A Banj&#257;ra who can read and write is unknown. But their memories, from cultivation, are marvellous and very retentive. They
carry in their heads, without slip or mistake, the most varied and complicated transactions and the share of each in such,
striking a debtor and creditor account as accurately as the best-kept ledger, while their history and songs are all learnt
by heart and transmitted orally from generation to generation. On the whole, and taken rightly in their clannish nature, their
virtues preponderate over their vices. In the main they are truthful and very brave, be it in war or the chase, and once gained
over are faithful and devoted adherents. With the pride of high descent and with the right that might gives in unsettled and
troublous times, these Banj&#257;ras habitually lord it over and contemn the settled inhabitants of the plains. And now not having
foreseen their own fate, or at least not timely having read the warnings given by a yearly diminishing occupation, which slowly
has taken their bread away, it is a bitter pill for them to sink into the ryot class or, oftener still, under stern necessity
to become the ryot&#8217;s servant. But they are settling to their fate, and the time must come when <a id="d0e5479"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5479">192</a>]</span>all their peculiar distinctive marks and traditions will be forgotten.&#8221;

to be a euphemism, eighteen castes being a term of indefinite multitude for any or no caste. The number eighteen may be selected

they were probably held sacred, and hence sewn on to clothes as a charm, just as gold and silver are used for ornaments.

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="d0e5355" href="#d0e5355src" class="noteref">51</a></span> Brewer&#8217;s <i>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i> contains the following notice of horns as an article of dress: &#8220;Mr. Buckingham says of a Tyrian lady, &#8216;She wore on her head
a hollow silver horn rearing itself up obliquely from the forehead. It was some four inches in diameter at the root and pointed
at the extremity. This peculiarity reminded me forcibly of the expression of the Psalmist: &#8220;Lift not up your horn on high;
speak not with a stiff neck. All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted&#8221;
(Ps. lxxv. 5, 10).&#8217; Bruce found in Abyssinia the silver horns of warriors and distinguished men. In the reign of Henry V.
the horned headgear was introduced into England and from the effigy of Beatrice, Countess of Arundel, at Arundel Church, who
is represented with the horns outspread to a great extent, we may infer that the length of the head-horn, like the length
of the shoe-point in the reign of Henry&nbsp;VI., etc., marked the degree of rank. To cut off such horns would be to degrade; and
to exalt and extend such horns would be to add honour and dignity to the wearer.&#8221; Webb (<i>Heritage of Dress</i>, p. 117) writes: &#8220;Mr. Elworthy in a paper to the British Association at Ipswich in 1865 considered the crown to be a development
from horns of honour. He maintained that the symbols found in the head of the god Serapis were the elements from which were
formed the composite head-dress called the crown into which horns entered to a very great extent.&#8221; This seems a doubtful speculation,
but still it may be quite possible that the idea of distinguishing by a crown the leader of the tribe was originally taken
from the antlers of the leader of the herd. The helmets of the Vikings were also, I believe, decorated with horns.

</span><h2>Barai</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5484">
<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Barai,<a id="d0e5490src" href="#d0e5490" class="noteref">1</a> Tamboli, Pans&#257;ri.</b>&#8212;The caste of growers and sellers of the betel-vine leaf. The three terms are used indifferently for the caste in the Central
Provinces, although some shades of variation in the meaning can be detected even here&#8212;Barai signifying especially one who
grows the betel-vine, and Tamboli the seller of the prepared leaf; while Pans&#257;ri, though its etymological meaning is also
a dealer in <i>p&#257;n</i> or betel-vine leaves, is used rather in the general sense of a druggist or grocer, and is apparently applied to the Barai
caste because its members commonly follow this occupation. In Bengal, however, Barai and Tamboli are distinct castes, the
occupations of growing and selling the betel-leaf being there separately practised. And they have been shown as different
castes in the India Census Tables of 1901, though it is perhaps doubtful whether the distinction holds good in northern India.<a id="d0e5497src" href="#d0e5497" class="noteref">2</a> In the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r the Barais numbered nearly 60,000 persons in 1911. They reside principally in the Amraoti,
Buld&#257;na, N&#257;gpur, Wardha, Saugor and Jubbulpore Districts. The betel-vine is grown principally in the northern Districts of
Saugor, Damoh and Jubbulpore and in those of Ber&#257;r and the N&#257;gpur plain. It is noticeable also that the growers and sellers
of the betel-vine numbered only 14,000 in 1911 out of 33,000 actual workers of the Barai caste; so that the majority of them
are now employed in ordinary agriculture, field-labour and other avocations. No very probable derivation has been obtained
for the word Barai, unless it comes from <i>b&#257;ri</i>, a hedge or enclosure, and simply means &#8216;gardener.&#8217; Another derivation is from <i>bar&#257;na,</i> to avert hailstorms, a calling which they still practise in northern India. <i>P&#257;n</i>, from the Sanskrit <i>parna</i> (leaf), is <i>the</i> leaf <a id="d0e5524"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5524">193</a>]</span><i>par excellence</i>. Owing to the fact that they produce what is perhaps the most esteemed luxury in the diet of the higher classes of native
society, the Barais occupy a fairly good social position, and one legend gives them a Br&#257;hman ancestry. This is to the effect
that the first Barai was a Br&#257;hman whom God detected in a flagrant case of lying to his brother. His sacred thread was confiscated
and being planted in the ground grew up into the first betel-vine, which he was set to tend. Another story of the origin of
the vine is given later in this article. In the Central Provinces its cultivation has probably only flourished to any appreciable
extent for a period of about three centuries, and the Barai caste would appear to be mainly a functional one, made up of a
number of immigrants from northern India and of recruits from different classes of the population, including a large proportion
of the non-Aryan element.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5528">
<h3>2. Caste subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The following endogamous divisions of the caste have been reported: Chaur&#257;sia, so called from the Chaur&#257;si pargana of the
M&#299;rz&#257;pur District; Panagaria from Pan&#257;gar in Jubbulpore; Mahobia from Mahoba in Ham&#299;rpur; Jaisw&#257;r from the town of Jais in
the Rai Bareli District of the United Provinces; Gangap&#257;ri, coming from the further side of the Ganges; and Pardeshi or Deshw&#257;ri,
foreigners. The above divisions all have territorial names, and these show that a large proportion of the caste have come
from northern India, the different batches of immigrants forming separate endogamous groups on their arrival here. Other subcastes
are the D&#363;dh Barais, from <i>d&#363;dh</i>, milk; the Kum&#257;n, said to be Kunbis who have adopted this occupation and become Barais; the Jharia and Kosaria, the oldest
or jungly Barais, and those who live in Chhatt&#299;sgarh; the Pur&#257;nia or old Barais; the Kumh&#257;rdhang, who are said to be the descendants
of a potter on whose wheel a betel-vine grew; and the Lahuri Sen, who are a subcaste formed of the descendants of irregular
unions. None of the other subcastes will take food from these last, and the name is locally derived from <i>lahuri</i>, lower, and <i>sen</i> or <i>shreni</i>, class. The caste is also divided into a large number of exogamous groups or septs which may be classified according to their
names as territorial, titular and totemistic. <a id="d0e5545"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5545">194</a>]</span>Examples of territorial names are: Kanaujia of Kanauj, Burh&#257;npuria of Burh&#257;npur, Chitoria of Chitor in R&#257;jput&#257;na, Deobijha
the name of a village in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, and Kharondiha from Kharond or K&#257;l&#257;handi State. These names must apparently have been
adopted at random when a family either settled in one of these places or removed from it to another part of the country. Examples
of titular names of groups are: Pandit (priest), Bhand&#257;ri (store-keeper), Patharha (hail-averter), Batk&#257;phor (pot-breaker),
Bhulya (the forgetful one), G&#363;jar (a caste), Gahoi (a caste), and so on. While the following are totemistic groups: Kat&#257;ra
(dagger), Kulha (jackal), Bandrele (monkey), Ch&#299;khalk&#257;r (from <i>ch&#299;khal</i>, mud), Richharia (bear), and others. Where the group is named after another caste it probably indicates that a man of that
caste became a Barai and founded a family; while the fact that some groups are totemistic shows that a section of the caste
is recruited from the indigenous tribes. The large variety of names discloses the diverse elements of which the caste is made
up.

<div class="div2" id="d0e5550">
<h3>3. Marriage</h3>
<p>Marriage within the <i>gotra</i> or exogamous group and within three degrees of relationship between persons connected through females is prohibited. Girls
are usually wedded before adolescence, but no stigma attaches to the family if they remain single beyond this period. If a
girl is seduced by a man of the caste she is married to him by the <i>p&#257;t</i>, a simple ceremony used for widows. In the southern Districts a barber cuts off a lock of her hair on the banks of a tank
or river by way of penalty, and a fast is also imposed on her, while the caste-fellows exact a meal from her family. If she
has an illegitimate child, it is given away to somebody else, if possible. A girl going wrong with an outsider is expelled
from the caste.

</p>
<p>Polygamy is permitted and no stigma attaches to the taking of a second wife, though it is rarely done except for special family
reasons. Among the Mar&#257;tha Barais the bride and bridegroom must walk five times round the marriage altar and then worship
the stone slab and roller used for pounding spices. This seems to show that the trade of the Pans&#257;ri or druggist is recognised
as being a proper avocation of the Barai. They subsequently have to worship the potter&#8217;s <a id="d0e5563"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5563">195</a>]</span>wheel. After the wedding the bride, if she is a child, goes as usual to her husband&#8217;s house for a few days. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh
she is accompanied by a few relations, the party being known as Chauthia, and during her stay in her husband&#8217;s house the bride
is made to sleep on the ground. Widow marriage is permitted, and the ceremony is conducted according to the usage of the locality.
In Bet&#363;l the relatives of the widow take the second husband before M&#257;roti&#8217;s shrine, where he offers a nut and some betel-leaf.
He is then taken to the m&#257;lguz&#257;r&#8217;s house and presents to him Rs. 1&#8211;4&#8211;0, a cocoanut and some betel-vine leaf as the price of
his assent to the marriage. If there is a Deshmukh<a id="d0e5565src" href="#d0e5565" class="noteref">3</a> of the village, a cocoanut and betel-leaf are also given to him. The nut offered to M&#257;roti represents the deceased husband&#8217;s
spirit, and is subsequently placed on a plank and kicked off by the new bridegroom in token of his usurping the other&#8217;s place,
and finally buried to lay the spirit. The property of the first husband descends to his children, and failing them his brother&#8217;s
children or collateral heirs take it before the widow. A bachelor espousing a widow must first go through the ceremony of
marriage with a swallow-wort plant. When a widower marries a girl a silver impression representing the deceased first wife
is made and worshipped daily with the family gods. Divorce is permitted on sufficient grounds at the instance of either party,
being effected before the caste committee or <i>panch&#257;yat</i>. If a husband divorces his wife merely on account of bad temper, he must maintain her so long as she remains unmarried and
continues to lead a moral life.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5571">
<h3>4. Religion and social status.</h3>
<p>The Barais especially venerate the N&#257;g or cobra and observe the festival of N&#257;g-Panchmi (Cobra&#8217;s fifth), in connection with
which the following story is related. Formerly there was no betel-vine on the earth. But when the five P&#257;ndava brothers celebrated
the great horse sacrifice after their victory at Hastinapur, they wanted some, and so messengers were sent down below the
earth to the residence of the queen of the serpents, in order to try and obtain it. B&#257;suki, the queen of the serpents, obligingly
cut off the top <a id="d0e5576"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5576">196</a>]</span>joint of her little finger and gave it to the messengers. This was brought up and sown on the earth, and <i>p&#257;n</i> creepers grew out of the joint. For this reason the betel-vine has no blossoms or seeds, but the joints of the creepers are
cut off and sown, when they sprout afresh; and the betel-vine is called N&#257;gbel or the serpent-creeper. On the day of N&#257;g-Panchmi
the Barais go to the <i>bareja</i> with flowers, cocoanuts and other offerings, and worship a stone which is placed in it and which represents the N&#257;g or cobra.
A goat or sheep is sacrificed and they return home, no leaf of the <i>p&#257;n</i> garden being touched on that day. A cup of milk is also left, in the belief that a cobra will come out of the <i>p&#257;n</i> garden and drink it. The Barais say that members of their caste are never bitten by cobras, though many of these snakes frequent
the gardens on account of the moist coolness and shade which they afford. The Agarw&#257;la Banias, from whom the Barais will take
food cooked without water, have also a legend of descent from a N&#257;ga or snake princess. &#8216;Our mother&#8217;s house is of the race
of the snake,&#8217; say the Agarw&#257;ls of Bih&#257;r.<a id="d0e5590src" href="#d0e5590" class="noteref">4</a> The caste usually burn the dead, with the exception of children and persons dying of leprosy or snake-bite, whose bodies
are buried. Mourning is observed for ten days in the case of adults and for three days for children. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh if any
portion of the corpse remains unburnt on the day following the cremation, the relatives are penalised to the extent of an
extra feast to the caste-fellows. Children are named on the sixth or twelfth day after birth either by a Br&#257;hman or by the
women of the household. Two names are given, one for ceremonial and the other for ordinary use. When a Br&#257;hman is engaged
he gives seven names for a boy and five for a girl, and the parents select one out of these. The Barais do not admit outsiders
into the caste, and employ Br&#257;hmans for religious and ceremonial purposes. They are allowed to eat the flesh of clean animals,
but very rarely do so, and they abstain from liquor. Br&#257;hmans will take sweets and water from them, and they occupy a fairly
good social position on account of the important nature of their occupation.

<h3>5. Occupation.</h3>
<p>&#8220;It has been mentioned,&#8221; says Sir H. Risley,<a id="d0e5601src" href="#d0e5601" class="noteref">5</a> &#8220;that the garden is regarded as almost sacred, and the superstitious practices in vogue resemble those of the silk-worm breeder.
The B&#257;rui will not enter it until he has bathed and washed his clothes. Animals found inside are driven out, while women ceremonially
unclean dare not enter within the gate. A Br&#257;hman never sets foot inside, and old men have a prejudice against entering it.
It has, however, been known to be used for assignations.&#8221; The betel-vine is the leaf of <i>Piper betel</i> L., the word being derived from the Malayalam <i>vettila</i>, &#8216;a plain leaf,&#8217; and coming to us through the Portuguese <i>betre</i> and <i>betle</i>. The leaf is called <i>p&#257;n</i>, and is eaten with the nut of <i>Areca catechu</i>, called in Hindi <i>sup&#257;ri</i>. The vine needs careful cultivation, the gardens having to be covered to keep off the heat of the sun, while liberal treatment
with manure and irrigation is needed. The joints of the creepers are planted in February, and begin to supply leaves in about
five months&#8217; time. When the first creepers are stripped after a period of nearly a year, they are cut off and fresh ones appear,
the plants being exhausted within a period of about two years after the first sowing. A garden may cover from half an acre
to an acre of land, and belongs to a number of growers, who act in partnership, each owning so many lines of vines. The plain
leaves are sold at from 2 annas to 4 annas a hundred, or a higher rate when they are out of season. Damoh, R&#257;mtek and Bilahri
are three of the best-known centres of cultivation in the Central Provinces. The Bilahri leaf is described in the <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> as follows: &#8220;The leaf called Bilahri is white and shining, and does not make the tongue harsh and hard. It tastes best of
all kinds. After it has been taken away from the creeper, it turns white with some care after a month, or even after twenty
days, when greater efforts are made.&#8221;<a id="d0e5630src" href="#d0e5630" class="noteref">6</a> For retail sale <i>b&#299;das</i> are prepared, consisting of a rolled betel-leaf containing areca-nut, catechu and lime, and fastened with a clove. Musk and
cardamoms are sometimes added. Tobacco should be smoked after eating a <i>b&#299;da</i> according to the saying, <a id="d0e5645"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5645">198</a>]</span>&#8216;Service without a patron, a young man without a shield, and betel without tobacco are alike savourless.&#8217; <i>B&#299;das</i> are sold at from two to four for a pice (farthing). Women of the caste often retail them, and as many are good-looking they
secure more custom; they are also said to have an indifferent reputation. Early in the morning, when they open their shops,
they burn some incense before the bamboo basket in which the leaves are kept, to propitiate Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth.

<h3>1. Strength and local distribution.</h3>
<p><b>Barhai, Sut&#257;r, Khar&#257;di, Mistri.</b>&#8212;The occupational caste of carpenters. The Barhais numbered nearly 110,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r in 1911,
or about 1 in 150 persons. The caste is most numerous in Districts with large towns, and few carpenters are to be found in
villages except in the richer and more advanced Districts. Hitherto such woodwork as the villagers wanted for agriculture
has been made by the Loh&#257;r or blacksmith, while the country cots, the only wooden article of furniture in their houses, could
be fashioned by their own hands or by the Gond woodcutter. In the Mandla District the Barhai caste counts only 300 persons,
and about the same in B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t, in Dr&#363;g only 47 persons, and in the fourteen Chhatt&#299;sgarh Feudatory States, with a population
of more than two millions, only some 800 persons. The name Barhai is said to be from the Sanskrit Vardhika and the root <i>vardh</i>, to cut. Sut&#257;r is a common name of the caste in the Mar&#257;tha Districts, and is from S&#363;tra-kara, one who works by string, or
a maker of string. The allusion may be to the Barhai&#8217;s use of string in planing or measuring timber, or it may possibly indicate
a transfer of occupation, the Sut&#257;rs having first been mainly string-makers and afterwards abandoned this calling for that
of the carpenter. The first wooden implements and articles of furniture may have been held together by string before nails
came into use. Khar&#257;di is literally a turner, one who turns woodwork on <a id="d0e5697"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5697">200</a>]</span>a lathe, from <i>khar&#257;t</i>, a lathe. Mistri, a corruption of the English Mister, is an honorific title for master carpenters.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5702">
<h3>2. Internal structure.</h3>
<p>The comparatively recent growth of the caste in these Provinces is shown by its subdivisions. The principal subcastes of the
Hindust&#257;ni Districts are the Pardeshi or foreigners, immigrants from northern India, and the P&#363;rbia or eastern, coming from
Oudh; other subcastes are the Sri Gaur M&#257;las or immigrants from M&#257;lwa, the Ber&#257;di from Ber&#257;r, and the M&#257;hure from Hyder&#257;b&#257;d.
We find also subcastes of J&#257;t and Teli Barhais, consisting of J&#257;ts and Telis (oil-pressers) who have taken to carpentering.
Two other caste-groups, the Cham&#257;r Barhais and Gondi Barhais, are returned, but these are not at present included in the Barhai
caste, and consist merely of Cham&#257;rs and Gonds who work as carpenters but remain in their own castes. In the course of some
generations, however, if the cohesive social force of the caste system continues unabated, these groups may probably find
admission into the Barhai caste. Colonel Tod notes that the progeny of one Mak&#363;r, a prince of the J&#257;don R&#257;jp&#363;t house of Jaisalmer,
became carpenters, and were known centuries after as Mak&#363;r Sut&#257;rs. They were apparently considered illegitimate, as he states:
&#8220;Illegitimate children can never overcome this natural defect among the R&#257;jp&#363;ts. Thus we find among all classes of artisans
in India some of royal but spurious descent.&#8221;<a id="d0e5707src" href="#d0e5707" class="noteref">1</a> The internal structure of the caste seems therefore to indicate that it is largely of foreign origin and to a certain degree
of recent formation in these Provinces.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5712">
<h3>3. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>The caste are also divided into exogamous septs named after villages. In some localities it is said that they have no septs,
but only surnames, and that people of the same surname cannot intermarry. Well-to-do persons marry their daughters before
puberty and others when they can afford the expense of the ceremony. Br&#257;hman priests are employed at weddings, though on other
occasions their services are occasionally dispensed with. The wedding ceremony is of the type prevalent in the locality. When
the wedding procession reaches the bride&#8217;s village it halts near the temple of M&#257;roti or Hanum&#257;n. Among the Panch&#257;l Barhais
the bridegroom does <a id="d0e5717"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5717">201</a>]</span>not wear a marriage crown but ties a bunch of flowers to his turban. The bridegroom&#8217;s party is entertained for five days.
Divorce and the remarriage of widows are permitted. In most localities it is said that a widow is forbidden to marry her first
husband&#8217;s younger as well as his elder brother. Among the Pardeshi Barhais of Bet&#363;l if a bachelor desires to marry a widow
he must first go through the ceremony with a branch or twig of the <i>g&#363;lar</i> tree.<a id="d0e5722src" href="#d0e5722" class="noteref">2</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5726">
<h3>4. Religion.</h3>
<p>The caste worship Viswakarma, the celestial architect, and venerate their trade implements on the Dasahra festival. They consider
the sight of a mongoose and of a light-grey pigeon or dove as lucky omens. They burn the dead and throw the ashes into a river
or tank, employing a Mah&#257;-Br&#257;hman to receive the gifts for the dead.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5731">
<h3>5. Social position.</h3>
<p>In social status the Barhais rank with the higher artisan castes. Br&#257;hmans take water from them in some localities, perhaps
more especially in towns. In Bet&#363;l for instance Hindust&#257;ni Br&#257;hmans do not accept water from the rural Barhais. In Damoh where
both the Barhai and Loh&#257;r are village menials, their status is said to be the same, and Brahmans do not take water from Loh&#257;rs.
Mr. Nesfield says that the Barhai is a village servant and ranks with the Kurmi, with whom his interests are so closely allied.
But there seems no special reason why the interests of the carpenter should be more closely allied with the cultivator than
those of any other village menial, and it may be offered as a surmise that carpentering as a distinct trade is of comparatively
late origin, and was adopted by Kurmis, to which fact the connection noticed by Mr. Nesfield might be attributed; hence the
position of the Barhai among the castes from whom a Br&#257;hman will take water. In some localities well-to-do members of the
caste have begun to wear the sacred thread.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5736">
<h3>6. Occupation.</h3>
<p>In the northern Districts and the cotton tract the Barhai works as a village menial. He makes and mends the plough and harrow
(<i>bakhar</i>) and other wooden implements of agriculture, and makes new ones when supplied with the wood. In Wardha he receives an annual
contribution of 100 lbs. of grain from each cultivator. In Bet&#363;l he gets 67 lbs. of grain <a id="d0e5744"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5744">202</a>]</span>and other perquisites for each plough of four bullocks. For making carts and building or repairing houses he must be separately
paid. At weddings the Barhai often supplies the sacred marriage-post and is given from four annas to a rupee. At the Diw&#257;li
festival he prepares a wooden peg about six inches long, and drives it into the cultivator&#8217;s house inside the threshold, and
receives half a pound to a pound of grain.

</p>
<p>In cities the carpenters are rapidly acquiring an increased degree of skill as the demand for a better class of houses and
furniture becomes continually greater and more extensive. The carpenters have been taught to make English furniture by such
institutions as the Friends&#8217; Mission of Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d and other missionaries; and a Government technical school has now been
opened at N&#257;gpur, in which boys from all over the Province are trained in the profession. Very little wood-carving with any
pretensions to excellence has hitherto been done in the Central Provinces, but the Jain temples at Saugor and Khurai contain
some fair woodwork. A good carpenter in towns can earn from 12 annas to Rs. 1&#8211;8 a day, and both his earnings and prospects
have greatly improved within recent years. Sherring remarks of the Barhais: &#8220;As artisans they exhibit little or no inventive
powers: but in imitating the workmanship of others they are perhaps unsurpassed in the whole world. They are equally clever
in working from designs and models.&#8221;<a id="d0e5748src" href="#d0e5748" class="noteref">3</a>

</span><h2>B&#257;ri</h2>
<p><b>B&#257;ri.</b>&#8212;A caste of household servants and makers of leaf-plates, belonging to northern India. The B&#257;ris numbered 1200 persons in
the Central Provinces in 1911, residing mainly in Jubbulpore and Mandla. Sir H. Risley remarks of the caste:<a id="d0e5760src" href="#d0e5760" class="noteref">1</a> &#8220;Mr. Nesfield regards the B&#257;ri as merely an offshoot from a semi-savage tribe known as Banm&#257;nush and Mus&#257;h&#257;r. He is said
still to associate with them at times, and if the demand for leaf-plates and cups, owing to some temporary cause, such as
a local fair or an unusual multitude of marriages, happens to become larger than he can at once supply, he gets them secretly
made by his ruder kinsfolk and retails them at a higher rate, passing <a id="d0e5765"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5765">203</a>]</span>them off as his own production. The strictest Br&#257;hmans, those at least who aspire to imitate the self-denying life of the
ancient Indian hermit, never eat off any other plates than those made of leaves.&#8221; &#8220;If the above view is correct,&#8221; Sir H. Risley
remarks, &#8220;the B&#257;ris are a branch of a non-Aryan tribe who have been given a fairly respectable position in the social system
in consequence of the demand for leaf-plates, which are largely used by the highest as well as the lowest castes. Instances
of this sort, in which a non-Aryan or mixed group is promoted on grounds of necessity or convenience to a higher status than
their antecedents would entitle them to claim, are not unknown in other castes, and must have occurred frequently in outlying
parts of the country, where the Aryan settlements were scanty and imperfectly supplied with the social apparatus demanded
by the theory of ceremonial purity.&#8221; There is no reason why the origin of the B&#257;ri from the Banm&#257;nush (wild man of the woods)
or Mus&#257;h&#257;r (mouse-eater), a forest tribe, as suggested by Mr. Nesfield from his observation of their mutual connection, should
be questioned. The making of leaf-plates is an avocation which may be considered naturally to pertain to the tribes frequenting
jungles from which the leaves are gathered; and in the Central Provinces, though in the north the Nai or barber ostensibly
supplies the leaf-plates, probably buying the leaves and getting them made up by Gonds and others, in the Mar&#257;tha Districts
the Gond himself does so, and many Gonds make their living by this trade. The people of the Mar&#257;tha country are apparently
less strict than those of northern India, and do not object to eat off plates avowedly the handiwork of Gonds. The fact that
the B&#257;ri has been raised to the position of a pure caste, so that Br&#257;hmans will take water from his hands, is one among several
instances of this elevation of the rank of the serving castes for purposes of convenience. The caste themselves have the following
legend of their origin: Once upon a time Parmeshwar<a id="d0e5767src" href="#d0e5767" class="noteref">2</a> was offering rice milk to the spirits of his ancestors. In the course of this ceremony the performer has to present a gift
known as Vikraya D&#257;n, which cannot be accepted by others without loss of position. Parmeshwar <a id="d0e5770"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5770">204</a>]</span>offered the gift to various Br&#257;hmans, but they all refused it. So he made a man of clay, and blew upon the image and gave
it life, and the god then asked the man whom he had created to accept the gift which the Br&#257;hmans had refused. This man, who
was the first B&#257;ri, agreed on condition that all men should drink with him and recognise his purity of caste. Parmeshwar then
told him to bring water in a cup, and drank of it in the presence of all the castes. And in consequence of this all the Hindus
will take water from the hands of a B&#257;ri. They also say that their first ancestor was named Sundar on account of his personal
beauty; but if so, he failed to bequeath this quality to his descendants. The proper avocation of the B&#257;ris is, as already
stated, the manufacture of the leaf-cups and plates used by all Hindus at festivals. In the Central Provinces these are made
from the large leaves of the <i>m&#257;hul</i> creeper (<i>Bauhinia Vahlii</i>), or from the <i>pal&#257;s</i> (<i>Butea frondosa</i>). The caste also act as personal servants, handing round water, lighting and carrying torches at marriages and other entertainments
and on journeys, and performing other functions. Some of them have taken to agriculture. Their women act as maids to high-caste
Hindu ladies, and as they are always about the zen&#257;na, are liable to lose their virtue. A curious custom prevails in M&#257;rw&#257;r
on the birth of an heir to the throne. An impression of the child&#8217;s foot is taken by a B&#257;ri on cloth covered with saffron,
and is exhibited to the native chiefs, who make him rich presents.<a id="d0e5784src" href="#d0e5784" class="noteref">3</a> The B&#257;ris have the reputation of great fidelity to their employers, and a saying about them is, &#8216;The B&#257;ri will die fighting
for his master.&#8217;

</span><h2>Basdewa</h2>
<p><b>Basdewa,<a id="d0e5796src" href="#d0e5796" class="noteref">1</a> Wasudeo, Harbola, Kaparia, Jaga, Kapdi.</b>&#8212;A wandering beggar caste of mixed origin, who also call themselves San&#257;dhya or Sanaurhia Br&#257;hmans. The Basdewas trace their
origin to Wasudeo, the father of Krishna, and the term Basdewa is a corruption of Wasudeo or Wasudeva. Kaparia is the name
they bear in the <a id="d0e5800"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5800">205</a>]</span>Anterved or country between the Ganges and Jumna, whence they claim to have come. Kaparia has been derived from <i>kapra</i>, cloth, owing to the custom of the Basdewas of having several dresses, which they change rapidly like the Bahr&#363;pia, making
themselves up in different characters as a show. Harbola is an occupational term, applied to a class of Basdewas who climb
trees in the early morning and thence vociferate praises of the deity in a loud voice. The name is derived from <i>Har</i>, God, and <i>bolna</i>, to speak. As the Harbolas wake people up in the morning they are also called Jaga or Awakener. The number of Basdewas in
the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r in 1911 was 2500, and they are found principally in the northern Districts and in Chhatt&#299;sgarh.
They have several territorial subcastes, as Gang&#257;putri or those who dwell on the banks of the Ganges; Khaltia or Desw&#257;ri,
those who belong to the Central Provinces; Parauha, from <i>para</i>, a male buffalo calf, being the dealers in buffaloes; Harbola or those who climb trees and sing the praises of God; and Wasudeo,
the dwellers in the Mar&#257;tha Districts who marry only among themselves. The names of the exogamous divisions are very varied,
some being taken from Br&#257;hman <i>gotras</i> and R&#257;jp&#363;t septs, while others are the names of villages, or nicknames, or derived from animals and plants. It may be concluded
from these names that the Basdewas are a mixed occupational group recruited from high and low castes, though they themselves
say that they do not admit any outsiders except Br&#257;hmans into the community. In Bombay<a id="d0e5817src" href="#d0e5817" class="noteref">2</a> the Wasudevas have a special connection with Kumh&#257;rs or potters, whom they address by the term of <i>k&#257;ka</i> or paternal uncle, and at whose houses they lodge on their travels, presenting their host with the two halves of a cocoanut.
The caste do not observe celibacy. A price of Rs. 25 has usually to be given for a bride, and a Br&#257;hman is employed to perform
the ceremony. At the conclusion of this the Br&#257;hman invests the bridegroom with a sacred thread, which he thereafter continues
to wear. Widow marriage is permitted, and widows are commonly married to widowers. Divorce is also permitted. When a man&#8217;s
wife dies he shaves his moustache and beard, if any, <a id="d0e5825"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5825">206</a>]</span>in mourning and a father likewise for a daughter-in-law; this is somewhat peculiar, as other Hindus do not shave the moustache
for a wife or daughter-in-law. The Basdewas are wandering mendicants. In the Mar&#257;tha Districts they wear a plume of peacock&#8217;s
feathers, which they say was given to them as a badge by Krishna. In Saugor and Damoh instead of this they carry during the
period from Dasahra to the end of M&#257;gh or from September to January a brass vessel called <i>matuk</i> bound on their heads. It is surmounted by a brass cone and adorned with mango-leaves, cowries and a piece of red cloth, and
with figures of R&#257;ma and Lakshman. Their stock-in-trade for begging consists of two <i>kart&#257;ls</i> or wooden clappers which are struck against each other; <i>ghungrus</i> or jingling ornaments for the feet, worn when dancing; and a <i>paijna</i> or kind of rattle, consisting of two semicircular iron wires bound at each end to a piece of wood with rings slung on to
them; this is simply shaken in the hand and gives out a sound from the movement of the rings against the wires. They worship
all these implements as well as their beggar&#8217;s wallet on the Janam-Ashtami or Krishna&#8217;s birthday, the Dasahra, and the full
moon of M&#257;gh (January). They rise early and beg only in the morning from about four till eight, and sing songs in praise of
Sarwan and Karan. Sarwan was a son renowned for his filial piety; he maintained and did service to his old blind parents to
the end of their lives, much against the will of his wife, and was proof against all her machinations to induce him to abandon
them. Karan was a proverbially charitable king, and all his family had the same virtue. His wife gave away daily rice and
pulse to those who required it, his daughter gave them clothes, his son distributed cows as alms and his daughter-in-law cocoanuts.
The king himself gave only gold, and it is related of him that he was accustomed to expend a maund and a quarter<a id="d0e5839src" href="#d0e5839" class="noteref">3</a> weight of gold in alms-giving before he washed himself and paid his morning devotions. Therefore the Basdewas sing that he
who gives early in the morning acquires the merit of Karan; and their presence at this time affords the requisite opportunity
to anybody who may be desirous of emulating the <a id="d0e5842"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5842">207</a>]</span>king. At the end of every couplet they cry &#8216;Jai Ganga&#8217; or &#8216;Har Ganga,&#8217; invoking the Ganges.

</p>
<p>The Harbolas have each a beat of a certain number of villages which must not be infringed by the others. Their method is to
ascertain the name of some well-to-do person in the village. This done, they climb a tree in the early morning before sunrise,
and continue chanting his praises in a loud voice until he is sufficiently flattered by their eulogies or wearied by their
importunity to throw down a present of a few pice under the tree, which the Harbola, descending, appropriates. The Basdewas
of the northern Districts are now commonly engaged in the trade of buying and selling buffaloes. They take the young male
calves from Saugor and Damoh to Chhatt&#299;sgarh, and there retail them at a profit for rice cultivation, driving them in large
herds along the road. For the capital which they have to borrow to make their purchases, they are charged very high rates
of interest. The Basdewas have here a special veneration for the buffalo as the animal from which they make their livelihood,
and they object strongly to the calves being taken to be tied out as baits for tiger, refusing, it is said, to accept payment
if the calf should be killed. Their social status is not high, and none but the lowest castes will take food from their hands.
They eat flesh and drink liquor, but abstain from pork, fowls and beef. Some of the caste have given up animal food.

<h3>1. Numbers and distribution.</h3>
<p><b>Basor,<a id="d0e5889src" href="#d0e5889" class="noteref">1</a> Bansphor, Dhulia, Burud.</b>&#8212;The occupational caste of bamboo-workers, the two first names being Hindi and the last the term used in the Mar&#257;tha Districts.
The cognate Uriya caste is called Kandra and the Telugu one Medara. The Basors numbered 53,000 persons in the Central Provinces
and Ber&#257;r in 1911. About half the total number reside in the Saugor, Damoh and Jubbulpore Districts. The word Basor is a corruption
of B&#257;nsphor, &#8216;a breaker of bamboos.&#8217; Dhulia, from <i>dholi</i>, a drum, means a musician.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5896">
<h3>2. Caste traditions.</h3>
<p>The caste trace their origin from Raja Benu or Venu who ruled at Singorgarh in Damoh. It is related of him that he was so
pious that he raised no taxes from his subjects, but earned his livelihood by making and selling bamboo fans. He could of
course keep no army, but he knew magic, and when he broke his fan the army of the enemy broke up in unison. Venu is a Sanskrit
word meaning bamboo. But a mythological Sanskrit king called Vena is mentioned in the Pur&#257;nas, from whom for his sins was
born the first Nish&#257;da, the lowest of human beings, and Manu<a id="d0e5901src" href="#d0e5901" class="noteref">2</a> states that the bamboo-worker is the issue of a <a id="d0e5904"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5904">209</a>]</span>Nish&#257;da or Chand&#257;l father and a Vaideha<a id="d0e5906src" href="#d0e5906" class="noteref">3</a> mother. So that the local story may be a corruption of the Br&#257;hmanical tradition. Another legend relates that in the beginning
there were no bamboos, and the first Basor took the serpent which Siva wore round his neck and going to a hill planted it
with its head in the ground. A bamboo at once sprang up on the spot, and from this the Basor made the first winnowing fan.
And the snake-like root of the bamboo, which no doubt suggested the story to its composer, is now adduced in proof of it.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5909">
<h3>3. Subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The Basors of the northern Districts are divided into a number of subcastes, the principal of which are: the Pur&#257;nia or Juthia,
who perhaps represent the oldest section, Pur&#257;nia being from <i>pur&#257;na</i> old; they are called Juthia because they eat the leavings of others; the Barmaiya or Malaiya, apparently a territorial group;
the Deshw&#257;ri or Bundelkhandi who reside in the <i>desh</i> or native place of Bundelkhand; the G&#363;dha or G&#363;rha, the name being derived by some from <i>g&#363;da</i> a pigsty; the Dumar or Dom Basors; the Dhubela, perhaps from the Dhobi caste; and the Dhark&#257;r. Two or three of the above
names appear to be those of other low castes from which the Basor caste may have been recruited, perhaps at times when a strong
demand existed for bamboo-workers. The Buruds do not appear to be sufficiently numerous to have subcastes. But they include
a few Telenga Buruds who are really Medaras, and the caste proper are therefore sometimes known as Mar&#257;tha Buruds to distinguish
them from these. The caste has numerous <i>bainks</i> or exogamous groups or septs, the names of which may chiefly be classified as territorial and totemistic. Among the former
are Mahobia, from the town of Mahoba; Sirmaiya, from Sirmau; Orahia, from Orai, the battlefield of the Ban&#257;phar generals,
Alha and Udal; Tikarahia from Tik&#257;ri, and so on. The totemistic septs include the S&#257;npero from <i>s&#257;np</i> a snake, the Mangrelo from <i>mangra</i> a crocodile, the Morya from <i>mor</i> a peacock, the Titya from the <i>titehri</i> bird and the Sarkia from <i>sarki</i> or red ochre, all of which worship their respective totems. The Katarya or &#8216;dagger&#8217; sept worship a real or painted dagger
at their marriage, and the Kemia, a branch <a id="d0e5941"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5941">210</a>]</span>of the <i>kem</i> tree (<i>Stephegyne parvifolia</i>). The Bandrelo, from <i>bandar</i>, worship a painted monkey. One or two groups are named after castes, as Bamhnelo from Br&#257;hman and Bargujaria from Barg&#363;jar
R&#257;jp&#363;t, thus indicating that members of these castes became Basors and founded families. One sept is called Marha from Marhai,
the goddess of cholera, and the members worship a picture of the goddess drawn in black. The name of the Kulh&#257;ntia sept means
somersault, and these turn a somersault before worshipping their gods. So strong is the totemistic idea that some of the territorial
groups worship objects with similar names. Thus the Mahobia group, whose name is undoubtedly derived from the town of Mahoba,
have adopted the mahua tree as their totem, and digging a small hole in the ground place in it a little water and the liquor
made from mahua flowers, and worship it. This represents the process of distillation of country liquor. Similarly, the Orahia
group, who derive their name from the town of Orai, now worship the <i>urai</i> or <i>khaskhas</i> grass, and the Tikarahia from Tik&#257;ri worship a <i>tikli</i> or glass spangle.

</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5965">
<h3>4. Marriage.</h3>
<p>The marriage of persons belonging to the same <i>baink</i> or sept and also that of first cousins is forbidden. The age of marriage is settled by convenience, and no stigma attaches
to its postponement beyond adolescence. Intrigues of unmarried girls with men of their own or any higher caste are usually
overlooked. The ceremony follows the standard Hindi and Mar&#257;thi forms, and presents no special features. A bride-price called
<i>ch&#257;ri</i>, amounting to seven or eight rupees, is usually paid. In Betul the practice of <i>lamjhana</i> or serving the father-in-law for a term of years before marrying his daughter, is sometimes followed. Widow-marriage is permitted,
and the widow is expected to wed her late husband&#8217;s younger brother. The Basors are musicians by profession, but in Bet&#363;l
the <i>narsingha</i>, a peculiar kind of crooked trumpet, is the only implement which may be played at the marriage of a widow. A woman marrying
a second time forfeits all interest in the property of her late husband, unless she is without issue and there are no near
relatives of her husband to take it. Divorce is effected by the breaking of the woman&#8217;s bangles in public. If obtained by
the wife, <a id="d0e5982"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5982">211</a>]</span>she must repay to her first husband the expenditure incurred by him for her marriage when she takes a second. But the acceptance
of this payment is considered derogatory and the husband refuses it unless he is poor.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5984">
<h3>5. Religion and social status.</h3>
<p>The Basors worship the ordinary Hindu deities and also ghosts and spirits. Like the other low castes they entertain a special
veneration for Devi. They profess to exorcise evil spirits and the evil eye, and to cure other disorders and diseases through
the agency of their incantations and the goblins who do their bidding. They burn their dead when they can afford it and otherwise
bury them, placing the corpse in the grave with its head to the north. The body of a woman is wrapped in a red shroud and
that of a man in a white one. They observe mourning for a period of three to ten days, but in Jubbulpore it always ends with
the fortnight in which the death takes place; so that a person dying on the 15th or 30th of the month is mourned only for
one day. They eat almost every kind of food, including beef, pork, fowls, liquor and the leavings of others, but abjure crocodiles,
monkeys, snakes and rats. Many of them have now given up eating cow&#8217;s flesh in deference to Hindu feeling. They will take
food from almost any caste except sweepers, and one or two others, as Joshi and Jasondhi, towards whom for some unexplained
reason they entertain a special aversion. They will admit outsiders belonging to any caste from whom they can take food into
the community. They are generally considered as impure, and live outside the village, and their touch conveys pollution, more
especially in the Mar&#257;tha Districts. The ordinary village menials, as the barber and washerman, will not work for them, and
services of this nature are performed by men of their own community. As, however, their occupation is not in itself unclean,
they rank above sweepers, Cham&#257;rs and Dhobis. Temporary exclusion from caste is imposed for the usual offences, and the almost
invariable penalty for readmission is a feast to the caste-fellows. A person, male or female, who has been convicted of adultery
must have the head shaved, and is then seated in the centre of the caste-fellows and pelted by them with the leavings of their
food. Basor women are not permitted to wear nose-rings on pain of exclusion from caste.

<a id="d0e5989"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5989">212</a>]</span>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e5991">
<h3>6. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The trade of the Basors is a very essential one to the agricultural community. They make numerous kinds of baskets, among
which may be mentioned the <i>chunka</i>, a very small one, the <i>tokni</i>, a basket of middle size, and the <i>tokna</i>, a very large one. The <i>dauri</i> is a special basket with a lining of matting for washing rice in a stream. The <i>jh&#257;npi</i> is a round basket with a cover for holding clothes; the <i>tipanna</i> a small one in which girls keep dolls; and the <i>bilahra</i> a still smaller one for holding betel-leaf. Other articles made from bamboo-bark are the <i>chalni</i> or sieve, the <i>khunkhuna</i> or rattle, the <i>b&#257;nsuri</i> or wooden flute, the <i>bijna</i> or fan, and the <i>s&#363;pa</i> or winnowing-fan. All grain is cleaned with the help of the <i>s&#363;pa</i> both on the threshing-floor and in the house before consumption, and a child is always laid in one as soon as it is born.
In towns the Basors make the bamboo matting which is so much used. The only implement they employ is the <i>b&#257;nka</i>, a heavy curved knife, with which all the above articles are made. The <i>b&#257;nka</i> is duly worshipped at the Diw&#257;li festival. The Basors are also the village musicians, and a band of three or four of them
play at weddings and on other festive occasions. Some of them work as pig-breeders and others are village watchmen. The women
often act as midwives. One subcaste, the Dum&#257;r, will do scavenger&#8217;s work, but they never take employment as <i>saises</i>, because the touch of horse-dung is considered as a pollution, entailing temporary excommunication from caste.

</span><h2>Bedar</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6047">
<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Bedar.<a id="d0e6053src" href="#d0e6053" class="noteref">1</a></b>&#8212;A small caste of about 1500 persons, belonging to Akola, Kh&#257;ndesh and Hyder&#257;b&#257;d. Their ancestors were Pind&#257;ris, apparently
recruited from the different Mar&#257;tha castes, and when the Pind&#257;ris were suppressed they obtained or were awarded land in the
localities where they now reside, and took to cultivation. The more respectable Bedars say that their ancestors were Tirole
Kunbis, but when Tipu Sult&#257;n invaded the Carnatic he took many of them prisoners and ordered them to become Muhammadans. In
order to please him they took food with Muhammadans, <a id="d0e6056"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6056">213</a>]</span>and on this account the Kunbis put them out of caste until they should purify themselves. But as there were a large number
of them, they did not do this, and have remained a separate caste. The real derivation of the name is unknown, but the caste
say that it is <i>be-dar</i> or &#8216;without fear,&#8217; and was given to them on account of their bravery. They have now obtained a warrant from the descendant
of Shankar Ach&#257;rya, or the high priest of Sivite Hindus, permitting them to describe themselves as P&#363;t Kunbi or purified Kunbi.<a id="d0e6061src" href="#d0e6061" class="noteref">2</a> The community is clearly of a most mixed nature, as there are also Dher or Mah&#257;r Bedars. They refuse to take food from other
Mah&#257;rs and consider themselves defiled by their touch. The social position of the caste also presents some peculiar features.
Several of them have taken service in the army and police, and have risen to the rank of native officer; and Rao S&#257;hib Dhonduji,
a retired Inspector of Police, is a prominent member of the caste. The R&#257;ja of Surpur, near Raichur, is also said to be a
Bedar, while others are ministerial officials occupying a respectable position. Yet of the Bedars generally it is said that
they cannot draw water freely from the public wells, and in N&#257;sik Bedar constables are not considered suitable for ordinary
duty, as people object to their entering houses. The caste must therefore apparently have higher and lower groups, differing
considerably in position.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6067">
<h3>2. Subdivisions and marriage customs.</h3>
<p>They have three subdivisions, the Mar&#257;tha, Telugu and Kande Bedars. The names of their exogamous sections are also Mar&#257;thi.
Nevertheless they retain one or two northern customs, presumably acquired from association with the Pind&#257;ris. Their women
do not tuck the body-cloth in behind the waist, but draw it over the right shoulder. They wear the <i>choli</i> or Hindust&#257;ni breast-cloth tied in front, and have a hooped silver ornament on the top of the head, which is known as <i>dhora</i>. They eat goats, fowls and the flesh of the wild pig, and drink liquor, and will take food from a Kunbi or a Phulm&#257;li, and
pay little heed to the rules of social impurity. But Hindust&#257;ni Br&#257;hmans act as their priests.

</p>
<p>Before a wedding they call a Br&#257;hman and worship him as a god, the ceremony being known as Deo Br&#257;hman. The <a id="d0e6080"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6080">214</a>]</span>Br&#257;hman then cooks food in the house of his host. On the same occasion a person specially nominated by the Br&#257;hman, and known
as Deokia, fetches an earthen vessel from the potter, and this is worshipped with offerings of turmeric and rice, and a cotton
thread is tied round it. Formerly it is said they worshipped the spent bullets picked up after a battle, and especially any
which had been extracted from the body of a wounded person.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6082">
<h3>3. Funeral rites.</h3>
<p>When a man is about to die they take him down from his cot and lay him on the ground with his head in the lap of a relative.
The dead are buried, a person of importance being carried to the grave in a sitting posture, while others are laid out in
the ordinary manner. A woman is buried in a green cloth and a breast-cloth. When the corpse has been prepared for the funeral
they take some liquor, and after a few drops have been poured into the mouth of the corpse the assembled persons drink the
rest. While following to the grave they beat drums and play on musical instruments and sing religious songs; and if a man
dies during the night, since he is not buried till the morning, they sit in the house playing and singing for the remaining
hours of darkness. The object of this custom must presumably be to keep away evil spirits. After the funeral each man places
a leafy branch of some tree or shrub on the grave, and on the thirteenth day they put food before a cow and also throw some
on to the roof of the house as a portion for the crows.

<p><b>Beld&#257;r,<a id="d0e6140src" href="#d0e6140" class="noteref">1</a> Od, Sonkar, R&#257;j, Larhia, K&#257;r&#299;gar, Matk&#363;da, Chunkar, Munurw&#257;r, Thapatkari, Vaddar, P&#257;throt, Tak&#257;ri.</b>&#8212;The term Beld&#257;r is generically applied to a number of occupational groups of more or less diverse origin, who work as masons
or navvies, build the earthen embankments of tanks or fields, carry lime and bricks and in former times refined salt. Beld&#257;r
means one who carries a <i>bel</i>, a hoe or mattock. In 1911 a total of 25,000 Beld&#257;rs were returned from the Central Provinces, being most numerous in the
Nim&#257;r, Wardha, N&#257;gpur, Ch&#257;nda and Raipur districts. The Nunia, Murha and S&#257;nsia (Uriya) castes, which have been treated in
separate articles, are also frequently known as Beld&#257;r, and cannot be clearly distinguished from the main caste. If they are
all classed together the total of the earth- and stone-working castes comes to 35,000 persons.

</p>
<p>It is probable that the bulk of the Beld&#257;rs and allied castes are derived from the non-Aryan tribes. The Murhas or navvies
of the northern Districts appear to be an offshoot of the Bind tribe; the people known as Matk&#363;da (earth-digger) are usually
Gonds or Pardh&#257;ns; the S&#257;nsias and Larhias or Uriyas of Chhatt&#299;sgarh and the Uriya country seem to have originated from the
Kol, Bhuiya and Oraon <a id="d0e6149"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6149">216</a>]</span>tribes, the Kols especially making excellent diggers and masons; the Oddes or Vaddars of Madras are a very low caste, and
some of their customs point to a similar origin, though the Munurw&#257;r masons of Ch&#257;nda appear to have belonged originally to
the K&#257;pu caste of cultivators.

</p>
<p>The term R&#257;j, which is also used for the Beld&#257;rs in the northern Districts, has the distinctive meaning of a mason, while
Ch&#363;nkar signifies a lime-burner. The Sonkars were formerly occupied in Saugor in carrying lime, bricks and earth on donkeys,
but they have now abandoned this calling in Chhatt&#299;sgarh and taken to growing vegetables, and have been given a short separate
notice. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d some Muhammadan Beld&#257;rs are now also found.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6153">
<h3>2. Beld&#257;rs of the northern Districts.</h3>
<p>The Beld&#257;rs of Saugor say that their ancestors were engaged in refining salt from earth. A divine saint named Nona R&#299;shi (<i>non</i>, salt) came down on earth, and while cooking his food mixed some saline soil with it. The bread tasted much better in consequence,
and he made the earth into a ball or <i>goli</i> and taught his followers to extract the salt from it, whence their descendants are known as Goli Beld&#257;rs. The customs of
these Beld&#257;rs are of the ordinary low-caste type. The wedding procession is accompanied by drums, fireworks and, if means
permit, a nautch-girl. If a man puts away his wife without adequate cause the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> may compel him to support her so long as she remains of good conduct. The party seeking a divorce, whether husband or wife,
has to pay Rs. 7 to the caste committee and the other partner Rs. 3, irrespective of where the blame rests, and each remains
out of caste until he or she pays.

</p>
<p>These Beld&#257;rs will not take food from any caste but their own, and will not take water from a Br&#257;hman, though they will accept
it from Kurmis, G&#363;jars and similar castes. Sir H. Risley notes that their women always remove earth in baskets on the head.
&#8220;The Beld&#257;rs regard this mode of carrying earth as distinctive of themselves, and will on no account transport it in baskets
slung from the shoulders. They work very hard when paid by the piece, and are notorious for their skill in manipulating the
pillars (<i>s&#257;khi</i>, witness) left to mark work done, so as to exaggerate the <a id="d0e6172"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6172">217</a>]</span>measurement. On one occasion while working for me on a large lake at Govindpur, in the north of the M&#257;nbhum District, a number
of Beld&#257;rs transplanted an entire pillar during the night and claimed payment for several thousand feet of imaginary earthwork.
The fraud was most skilfully carried out, and was only detected by accident.<span id="d0e6174" class="corr" title="Source: ">&#8221;</span><a id="d0e6176src" href="#d0e6176" class="noteref">2</a> The Beld&#257;rs are often dishonest in their dealings, and will take large advances for a tank or embankment, and then abscond
with the money without doing the work. During the open season parties of the caste travel about in camp looking for work,
their furniture being loaded on donkeys. They carry grain in earthen pots encased in bags of netting, neatly and closely woven,
and grind their wheat daily in a small mill set on a goat-skin. Butter is made in one of their pots with a churning-stick,
consisting of a cogged wheel fixed on to the end of a wooden rod.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6181">
<h3>3. Odias of Chhatt&#299;sgarh.</h3>
<p>The Beld&#257;rs of Chhatt&#299;sgarh are divided into the Odia or Uriya, Larhia, K&#363;chbandhia, Matk&#363;da and K&#257;r&#299;gar groups. Uriya and
Larhia are local names, applied to residents of the Uriya country and Chhatt&#299;sgarh respectively. Odia is the name of a low
Madras caste of masons, but whether it is a corruption of Uriya is not clear. K&#257;r&#299;gar means a workman, and K&#363;chbandhia is
the name of a separate caste, who make loom-combs for weavers. The Odias pretend to be fallen R&#257;jp&#363;ts. They say that when
Indra stole the sacrificial horse of R&#257;ja S&#257;gar and kept it in the underworld, the R&#257;ja&#8217;s thousand sons dug great holes through
the earth to get it. Finally they arrived at the underworld and were all reduced to ashes by the R&#299;shi Kapil Muni, who dwelt
there. Their ghosts besought him for life, and he said that their descendants should always continue to dig holes in the earth,
which would be used as tanks; and that whenever a tank was dug by them, and its marriage celebrated with a sacrifice, the
savour of the sacrifice would descend to the ghosts and would afford them sustenance. The Odias say that they are the descendants
of the R&#257;ja&#8217;s sons, and unless a tank is dug and its marriage celebrated by them it remains impure. These Odias have their
tutelary deity in Rewah State, and at his shrine is <a id="d0e6186"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6186">218</a>]</span>a flag which none but an Odia of genuine descent from R&#257;ja S&#257;gar&#8217;s sons can touch without some injury befalling him. If any
Beld&#257;ar therefore claims to belong to their caste they call on him to touch the flag, and if he does so with impunity they
acknowledge him as a brother.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6188">
<h3>4. Other Chhatt&#299;sgarhi Beld&#257;rs.</h3>
<p>The other group of Chatt&#299;sgarhi Beld&#257;rs are of lower status, and clearly derived from the non-Aryan tribes. They eat pigs,
and at intervals of two or three years they celebrate the worship of Gosain Deo with a sacrifice of pigs, the deity being
apparently a deified ascetic or mendicant. On this occasion the Dh&#299;mars, Gonds, and all other castes which eat pig&#8217;s flesh
join in the sacrifice, and consume the meat together after the fashion of the rice at Jagann&#257;th&#8217;s temple, which all castes
may eat together without becoming impure. These Beld&#257;rs use asses for the transport of their bricks and stones, and on the
Diw&#257;li day they place a lamp before the ass and pay reverence to it. They say that at their marriages a bride-price of Rs.
100 or Rs. 200 must always be paid, but they are allowed to give one or two donkeys and value them at Rs. 50 apiece. They
make grindstones (<i>chakki</i>), combs for straightening the threads on the loom, and frames for stretching the threads. These frames are called <i>dongi</i>, and are made either wholly or partly from the horns of animals, a fact which no doubt renders them impure.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6199">
<h3>5. Munurw&#257;r and Telenga.</h3>
<p>In Ch&#257;nda the principal castes of stone-workers are the Telengas (Telugus), who are also known as Th&#257;patkari (tapper or chiseller),
Telenga Kunbi and Munurw&#257;r. They occupy a higher position than the ordinary Beld&#257;r, and Kunbis will take water from them and
sometimes food. They say that they came into Ch&#257;nda from the Telugu country along the God&#257;vari and Pr&#257;nhita rivers to build
the great wall of Chanda and the palaces and tombs of the Gond kings. There is no reason to doubt that the Munurw&#257;rs are a
branch of the K&#257;pu cultivating caste of the Telugu country. Mr. A. K. Smith states that they refuse to eat the flesh of an
animal which has been skinned by a Mah&#257;r, a Cham&#257;r, or a Gond; the Kunbis and Mar&#257;thas also consider flesh touched by a Mah&#257;r
or Cham&#257;r to be impure, but do not object to a Gond. Like the Ber&#257;r <a id="d0e6204"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6204">219</a>]</span>Kunbis, the Telengas prefer that an animal should be killed by the rite of <i>hal&#257;l</i> as practised by Muhammadan butchers. The reason no doubt is that the <i>hal&#257;l</i> is a method of sacrificial slaughter, and the killing of the animal is legitimised even though by the ritual of a foreign
religion. The Th&#257;patkaris appear to be a separate group, and their original profession was to collect and retail jungle fruits
and roots having medicinal properties. Though the majority have become stone- and earth-workers some of them still do this.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6212">
<h3>6. Vaddar.</h3>
<p>The Vaddars or Wadew&#257;rs are a branch of the Odde caste of Madras. They are almost an impure caste, and a section of them are
professional criminals. Their women wear glass bangles only on the left arm, those on the right arm being made of brass or
other metal. This rule has no doubt been introduced because glass bangles would get broken when they were supporting loads
on the head. The men often wear an iron bangle on the left wrist, which they say keeps off the lightning. Mr. Thurston states
that &#8220;Women who have had seven husbands are much respected among the Oddes, and their blessing on a bridal pair is greatly
prized. They work in gangs on contract, and every one, except very old and very young, shares in the labour. The women carry
the earth in baskets, while the men use the pick and spade. The babies are usually tied up in cloths, which are suspended,
hammock-fashion, from the boughs of trees. A woman found guilty of immorality is said to have to carry a basketful of earth
from house to house before she is readmitted to the caste. The stone-cutting Vaddars are the principal criminals, and by going
about under the pretence of mending grindstones they obtain much useful information as to the houses to be looted or parties
of travellers to be attacked. In committing a highway robbery or dacoity they are always armed with stout sticks.&#8221;<a id="d0e6217src" href="#d0e6217" class="noteref">3</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6222">
<h3>7. P&#257;throt.</h3>
<p>In Ber&#257;r besides the regular Beld&#257;rs two castes of stone-workers are found, the Pathr&#257;wats or P&#257;throts (stone-breakers) and
the Tak&#257;ris, who should perhaps be classed as separate castes. Both make and sharpen millstones and grindstones, and they
are probably only occupational groups of recent formation. The Tak&#257;ris are connected with the P&#257;rdhi caste <a id="d0e6227"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6227">220</a>]</span>of professional hunters and fowlers and may be a branch of them. The social customs of the P&#257;throts resemble those of the
Kunbis. &#8220;They will take cooked food from a Sut&#257;r or a Kumbh&#257;r. Imprisonment, the killing of a cow or criminal intimacy of
a man with a woman of another caste is punished by temporary outcasting, readmission involving a fine of Rs. 4 or Rs. 5. Their
chief deity is the Devi of Tulj&#257;pur and their chief festival Dasahra; the implements of the caste are worshipped twice a year,
on Gudhi P&#257;dwa and Diw&#257;li. Women are tattooed with a crescent between the eyebrows and dots on the right side of the nose,
the right cheek, and the chin, and a basil plant or peacock is drawn on their wrists.&#8221;<a id="d0e6229src" href="#d0e6229" class="noteref">4</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6234">
<h3>8. Tak&#257;ri.</h3>
<p>&#8220;The Tak&#257;ris take their name from the verb <i>t&#257;kne</i>, to reset or rechisel. They mend the handmills (<i>chakkis</i>) used for grinding corn, an occupation which is sometimes shared with them by the Langoti P&#257;rdhis. The Tak&#257;ri&#8217;s avocation
of chiselling grindstones gives him excellent opportunities for examining the interior economy of houses, and the position
of boxes and cupboards, and for gauging the wealth of the inmates. They are the most inveterate house-breakers and dangerous
criminals. A form of crime favoured by the Tak&#257;ri, in common with many other criminal classes, is that of decoying into a
secluded spot outside the village the would-be receiver of stolen property and robbing him of his cash&#8212;a trick which carries
a wholesome lesson with it.&#8221;<a id="d0e6245src" href="#d0e6245" class="noteref">5</a> The chisel with which they chip the grindstones furnishes, as stated by Mr. D. A. Smyth, D.S.P., an excellent implement for
breaking a hole through the mud wall of a house.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6279">
<h3>1. Historical notice.</h3>
<p>A caste of gipsies and thieves who are closely connected with the S&#257;nsias. In 1891 they numbered 906 <a id="d0e6284"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6284">221</a>]</span>persons in the Central Provinces, distributed over the northern Districts; in 1901 they were not separately classified but
were identified with the Nats. &#8220;They say that some generations ago two brothers resided in the Bhartpur territory, of whom
one was named Sains M&#363;l and the other Mullanur. The descendants of Sains M&#363;l are the S&#257;nsias and those of Mullanur the Berias
or Kolh&#257;tis, who are vagrants and robbers by hereditary profession, living in tents or huts of matting, like Nats or other
vagrant tribes, and having their women in common without any marriage ceremonies or ties whatsoever. Among themselves or their
relatives the S&#257;nsias or descendants of Sains M&#363;l, they are called Dholi or Kolh&#257;ti. The descendants of the brothers eat,
drink and smoke together, and join in robberies, but never intermarry.&#8221; So Colonel Sleeman wrote in 1849, and other authorities
agree on the close connection or identity of the Berias and S&#257;nsias of Central India. The Kolh&#257;tis belong mainly to the Deccan
and are apparently a branch of the Berias, named after the <i>Kolh&#257;n</i> or long pole with which they perform acrobatic feats. The Berias of Central India differ in many respects from those of Bengal.
Here Sir H. Risley considers Beria to be &#8216;the generic name of a number of vagrant, gipsy-like groups&#8217;; and a full description
of them has been given by B&#257;bu R&#257;jendra L&#257;l Mitra, who considers them to resemble the gipsies of Europe. &#8220;They are noted for
a light, elastic, wiry make, very uncommon in the people of this country. In agility and hardness they stand unrivalled. The
men are of a brownish colour, like the bulk of Bengalis, but never black. The women are of lighter complexion and generally
well-formed; some of them have considerable claims to beauty, and for a race so rude and primitive in their habits as the
Berias, there is a sharpness in the features of their women which we see in no other aboriginal race in India. Like the gipsies
of Europe they are noted for the symmetry of their limbs; but their offensive habits, dirty clothing and filthy professions
give them a repulsive appearance, which is heightened by the reputation they have of kidnapping children and frequenting burial-grounds
and places of cremation.... Familiar with the use of bows and arrows and great adepts in <a id="d0e6289"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6289">222</a>]</span>laying snares and traps, they are seldom without large supplies of game and flesh of wild animals of all kinds. They keep
the dried bodies of a variety of birds for medical purposes; mongoose, squirrels and flying-foxes they eat with avidity as
articles of luxury. Spirituous liquors and intoxicating drugs are indulged in to a large extent, and chiefs of clans assume
the title of Bhangi or drinkers of hemp (<i>bh&#257;ng</i>) as a mark of honour.... In lying, thieving and knavery the Beria is not a whit inferior to his brother gipsy of Europe.
The Beria woman deals in charms for exorcising the devil and palmistry is her special vocation. She also carries with her
a bundle of herbs and other real or pretended charms against sickness of body or mind; and she is much sought after by village
maidens for the sake of the philtre with which she restores to them their estranged lovers; while she foretells the date when
absent friends will return and the sex of unborn children. They practise cupping with buffalo horns, pretend to extract worms
from decayed teeth and are commonly employed as tattooers. At home the Beria woman makes mats of palm-leaves, while her lord
alone cooks.... Beria women are even more circumspect than European gipsies. If a wife does not return before the jackal&#8217;s
cry is heard in the evening, she is subject to severe punishment. It is said that a <i>faux pas</i> among her own kindred is not considered reprehensible; but it is certain that no Berini has ever been known to be at fault
with any one not of her own caste.&#8221; This last statement is not a little astonishing, inasmuch as in Central India and in Bundelkhand
Berni is an equivalent term for a prostitute. A similar diversity of conjugal morality has been noticed between the B&#257;gris
of northern India and the V&#257;ghris of Gujar&#257;t.<a id="d0e6297src" href="#d0e6297" class="noteref">1</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6300">
<h3>2. Criminal tendencies in the Central Provinces.</h3>
<p>In other respects also the Berias of Bengal appear to be more respectable than the remainder of the caste, obtaining their
livelihood by means which, if disreputable, are not actually dishonest; while in Central India the women Berias are prostitutes
and the men house-breakers and thieves. These latter are so closely connected with the S&#257;nsias that the account of that caste
is also applicable to the Berias. <a id="d0e6305"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6305">223</a>]</span>In Jubbulpore, Mr. Gayer states, the caste are expert house-breakers, bold and daring, and sometimes armed with swords and
matchlocks. They sew up stolen property in their bed-quilts and secrete it in the hollow legs of their sleeping-cots, and
the women habitually conceal jewels and even coins in the natural passages of the body, in which they make special <i>saos</i> or receptacles by practice. The Beria women go about begging, and often break open the doors of unoccupied houses in the
daytime and steal anything they can find.<a id="d0e6310src" href="#d0e6310" class="noteref">2</a> Both S&#257;nsia and Beria women wear a <i>laong</i> or clove in the left nostril.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6316">
<h3>3. Social customs.</h3>
<p>As already stated, the women are professional prostitutes, but these do not marry, and on arrival at maturity they choose
the life which they prefer. Mr. Crooke states,<a id="d0e6321src" href="#d0e6321" class="noteref">3</a> however, that regular marriages seldom occur among them, because nearly all the girls are reserved for prostitution, and
the men keep concubines drawn from any fairly respectable caste. So far is this the rule that in some localities if a man
marries a girl of the tribe he is put out of caste or obliged to pay a fine to the tribal council. This last rule does not
seem to obtain in the Central Provinces, but marriages are uncommon. In a colony of Berias in Jubbulpore<a id="d0e6324src" href="#d0e6324" class="noteref">4</a> numbering sixty families it was stated that only eight weddings could be remembered as having occurred in the last fifty
years. The boys therefore have to obtain wives as best they can; sometimes orphan girls from other castes are taken into the
community, or any outsider is picked up. For a bride from the caste itself a sum of Rs. 100 is usually demanded, and the same
has to be paid by a Beria man who takes a wife from the Nat or Kanjar castes, as is sometimes done. When a match is proposed
they ask the expectant bridegroom how many thefts he has committed without detection; and if his performances have been inadequate
they refuse to give him the girl on the ground that he will be unable to support a wife. At the betrothal the boy&#8217;s parents
go to the girl&#8217;s house, taking with them a potful of liquor round which a silver ring is placed and a <a id="d0e6327"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6327">224</a>]</span>pig. The ring is given to the girl and the head of the pig to her father, while the liquor and the body of the pig provide
a feast for the caste. They consult Br&#257;hmans at their birth and marriage ceremonies. Their principal deities appear to be
their ancestors, whom they worship on the same day of the month and year as that on which their death took place. They make
an offering of a pig to the goddess Dadaju or Devi before starting on their annual predatory excursions. Some rice is thrown
into the animal&#8217;s ear before it is killed, and the direction in which it turns its head is selected as the one divinely indicated
for their route. Prostitution is naturally not regarded as any disgrace, and the women who have selected this profession mix
on perfectly equal terms with those who are married. They occupy, in fact, a more independent position, as they dispose absolutely
of their own earnings and property, and on their death it devolves on their daughters or other female relatives, males having
no claim to it, in some localities at least. Among the children of married couples daughters inherit equally with sons. A
prostitute is regarded as the head of the family so far as her children are concerned. Outsiders are freely admitted into
the caste on giving a feast to the community. In Saugor the women of the caste, known as Berni, are the village dancing-girls,
and are employed to give performances in the cold weather, especially at the Holi festival, where they dance the whole night
through, fortified by continuous potations of liquor. This dance is called <i>rai</i>, and is accompanied by most obscene songs and gestures.

<h3>1. The tribe derived from the Baigas.</h3>
<p><b>Bhaina.</b><a id="d0e6380src" href="#d0e6380" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A primitive tribe peculiar to the Central Provinces and found principally in the Bil&#257;spur District and the adjoining area,
that is, in the wild tract of forest country between the Satp&#363;ra range and the south of the Chota N&#257;gpur plateau. In 1911
about 17,000 members of the tribe were returned. The tribe is of mixed descent and appears to have been derived principally
from the Baigas and Kawars, having probably served as a city of refuge to persons expelled from these and other tribes and
the lower castes for irregular sexual relations. Their connection with the Baigas is shown by the fact that in Mandla the
Baigas have two subdivisions, which are known as Rai or R&#257;j-Bhaina, and Kath, or catechu-making Bhaina. The name therefore
would appear to have originated with the Baiga tribe. A Bhaina is also not infrequently found to be employed in the office
of village priest and magician, which goes by the name of Baiga in Bil&#257;spur. And a Bhaina has the same reputation as a Baiga
for sorcery, it being said of him&#8212;

This reputation simply arises from the fact that in his capacity of village priest the Bhaina performs the various magical
devices which lay the ghosts of the dead, protect the village against tigers, ensure the prosperity of the crops and so on.
But it is always the older residents of any locality who are employed by later comers in this office, because they are considered
to have a more intimate acquaintance with the local deities. And consequently we are entitled to assume that the Bhainas are
older residents of the country where they are found than their neighbours, the Gonds and Kawars. There is other evidence to
the same effect; for instance, the oldest forts in Bil&#257;spur are attributed to the Bhainas, and a chief of this tribe is remembered
as having ruled in Bilaigarh; they are also said to have been dominant in Pendra, where they are still most numerous, though
the estate is now held by a Kawar; and it is related that the Bhainas were expelled from Phuljhar in Raipur by the Gonds.
Phuljhar is believed to be a Gond State of long standing, and the R&#257;ja of Raigarh and others claim to be descended from its
ruling family. A manuscript history of the Phuljhar chiefs records that that country was held by a Bhaina king when the Gonds
invaded it, coming from Ch&#257;nda. The Bhaina with his soldiers took refuge in a hollow underground chamber with two exits. But
the secret of this was betrayed to the Gonds by an old Gond woman, and they filled up the openings of the chamber with grass
and burnt the Bhainas to death. On this account the tribe will not enter Phuljhar territory to this day, and say that it is
death to a Bhaina to do so. The Binjhw&#257;rs are also said to have been dominant in the hills to the east of Raipur District,
and they too are a civilised branch of the Baigas. And in all this area the village priest is commonly known as Baiga, the
deduction from which is, as already stated, that the Baigas were the oldest residents.<a id="d0e6394src" href="#d0e6394" class="noteref">2</a> It seems a legitimate conclusion, therefore, that prior to the immigration of the <a id="d0e6397"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6397">227</a>]</span>Gonds and Kawars, the ancient Baiga tribe was spread over the whole hill country east and north of the Mah&#257;nad&#299; basin.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6399">
<h3>2. Closely connected with the Kawars.</h3>
<p>The Bhainas are also closely connected with the Kawars, who still own many large estates in the hills north of Bil&#257;spur. It
is said that formerly the Bhainas and Kawars both ate in common and intermarried, but at present, though the Bhainas still
eat rice boiled in water from the Kawars, the latter do not reciprocate. But still, when a Kawar is celebrating a birth, marriage
or death in his family, or when he takes in hand to make a tank, he will first give food to a Bhaina before his own caste-men
eat. And it may safely be assumed that this is a recognition of the Bhaina&#8217;s position as having once been lord of the land.
A Kawar may still be admitted into the Bhaina community, and it is said that the reason of the rupture of the former equal
relations between the two tribes was the disgust felt by the Kawars for the rude and uncouth behaviour of the Bhainas. For
on one occasion a Kawar went to ask for a Bhaina girl in marriage, and, as the men of the family were away, the women undertook
to entertain him. And as the Bhainas had no axes, the daughter proceeded to crack the sticks on her head for kindling a fire,
and for grass she pulled out a wisp of thatch from the roof and broke it over her thigh, being unable to chop it. This so
offended the delicate susceptibilities of the Kawar that he went away without waiting for his meal, and from that time the
Kawars ceased to marry with the Bhainas. It seems possible that the story points to the period when the primitive Bhainas
and Baigas did not know the use of iron and to the introduction of this metal by the later-coming Kawars and Gonds. It is
further related that when a Kawar is going to make a ceremonial visit he likes always to take with him two or three Bhainas,
who are considered as his retainers, though not being so in fact. This enhances his importance, and it is also said that the
stupidity of the Bhainas acts as a foil, through which the superior intelligence of the Kawar is made more apparent. All these
details point to the same conclusion that the primitive Bhainas first held the country and were supplanted by the more civilised
Kawars, and bears <a id="d0e6404"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6404">228</a>]</span>out the theory that the settlement of the Munda tribes was prior to those of the Dravidian family.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6406">
<h3>3. Internal structure: Totemism.</h3>
<p>The tribe has two subdivisions of a territorial nature, Laria or Chhatt&#299;sgarhi, and Uriya. The Uriya Bhainas will accept food
cooked without water from the Sawaras or Saonrs, and these also from them; so that they have probably intermarried. Two other
subdivisions recorded are the Jhaly&#257;ra and Ghanty&#257;ra or Ghaty&#257;ra; the former being so called because they live in <i>jh&#257;las</i> or leaf huts in the forest, and the latter, it is said, because they tie a <i>ghanta</i> or bell to their doors. This, however, seems very improbable. Another theory is that the word is derived from <i>gh&#257;t</i>, a slope or descent, and refers to a method which the tribe have of tattooing themselves with a pattern of lines known as
<i>gh&#257;t</i>. Or it is said to mean a low or despised section. The Jhaly&#257;ra and Ghaty&#257;ra divisions comprise the less civilised portion
of the tribe, who still live in the forests; and they are looked down on by the Uriya and Laria sections, who belong to the
open country. The exogamous divisions of the tribe show clearly enough that the Bhainas, like other subject races, have quite
failed to preserve any purity of blood. Among the names of their <i>gots</i> or septs are Dhobia (a washerman), Ahera (cowherd), Gond, Mallin (gardener), Panika (from a Panka or Ganda) and others. The
members of such septs pay respect to any man belonging to the caste after which they are named and avoid picking a quarrel
with him. They also worship the family gods of this caste. The tribe have also a number of totem septs, named after animals
or plants. Such are N&#257;g the cobra, B&#257;gh the tiger, Chitwa the leopard, Gidha the vulture, Besra the hawk, Bendra the monkey,
Kok or Lodha the wild dog, Bataria the quail, Durgachhia the black ant, and so on. Members of a sept will not injure the animal
after which it is named, and if they see the corpse of the animal or hear of its death, they throw away an earthen cooking-pot
and bathe and shave themselves as for one of the family. Members of the Baghchh&#257;l or tiger sept will, however, join in a beat
for tiger though they are reluctant to do so. At weddings the Bhainas have a ceremony known as the <i>gotra</i> worship. The bride&#8217;s father <a id="d0e6429"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6429">229</a>]</span>makes an image in clay of the bird or animal of the groom&#8217;s sept and places it beside the marriage-post. The bridegroom worships
the image, lighting a sacrificial fire before it, and offers to it the vermilion which he afterwards smears upon the forehead
of the bride. At the bridegroom&#8217;s house a similar image is made of the bride&#8217;s totem, and on returning there after the wedding
she worships this. Women are often tattooed with representations of their totem animal, and men swear by it as their most
sacred oath. A similar respect is paid to the inanimate objects after which certain septs are named. Thus members of the Gawad
or cowdung sept will not burn cowdung cakes for fuel; and those of the Mircha sept do not use chillies. One sept is named
after the sun, and when an eclipse occurs these perform the same formal rites of mourning as the others do on the death of
their totem animal. Some of the groups have two divisions, male and female, which practically rank as separate septs. Instances
of these are the N&#257;gbans Andura and the N&#257;gbans Mai or male and female cobra septs; the Karsay&#257;l Singhara and Karsay&#257;l Mundi
or stag and doe deer septs; and the Baghchh&#257;l Andura and Baghchh&#257;l Mai or tiger and tigress septs. These may simply be instances
of subdivisions arising owing to the boundaries of the sept having become too large for convenience.

<h3>4. Marriage.</h3>
<p>The tribe consider that a boy should be married when he has learnt to drive the plough, and a girl when she is able to manage
her household affairs. When a father can afford a bride for his son, he and his relatives go to the girl&#8217;s village, taking
with them ten or fifteen cakes of bread and a bottle of liquor. He stays with some relative and sends to ask the girl&#8217;s father
if he will give his daughter to the inquirer&#8217;s son. If the former agrees, the bread and liquor are sent over to him, and he
drinks three cups of the spirit as a pledge of the betrothal, the remainder being distributed to the company. This is known
as <i lang="und">Tatia kholna</i> or &#8216;the opening of the door,&#8217; and is followed some days afterwards by a similar ceremonial which constitutes the regular
betrothal. On this occasion the father agrees to marry his daughter within a year and demands the bride-price, which consists
of rice, cloth, a goat and other articles, <a id="d0e6439"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6439">230</a>]</span>the total value being about five rupees. A date is next fixed for the wedding, the day selected being usually a Monday or
Friday, but no date or month is forbidden. The number of days to the wedding are then counted, and two knotted strings are
given to each party, with a knot for each day up to that on which the anointings with oil and turmeric will commence at the
bridegroom&#8217;s and bride&#8217;s houses. Every day one knot is untied at each house up to that on which the ceremonies begin, and
thus the correct date for them is known. The invitations to the wedding are given by distributing rice coloured yellow with
turmeric to all members of the caste in the locality, with the intimation that the wedding procession will start on a certain
day and that they will be pleased to attend. During the four days that they are being anointed the bride and bridegroom dance
at their respective houses to the accompaniment of drums and other instruments. For the wedding ceremony a number of Hindu
rites have been adopted. The eldest sister of the bridegroom or bride is known as the <i>saw&#257;sin</i> and her husband as the <i>saw&#257;sa</i>, and these persons seem to act as the representatives of the bridal couple throughout the marriage and to receive all presents
on their behalf. The custom is almost universal among the Hindus, and it is possible that they are intended to act as substitutes
and to receive any strokes of evil fortune which may befall the bridal pair at a season at which they are peculiarly liable
to it. The couple go round the sacred post, and afterwards the bridegroom daubs the bride&#8217;s forehead with red lead seven times
and covers her head with her cloth to show that she has become a married woman. After the wedding the bridegroom&#8217;s parents
say to him, &#8220;Now your parents have done everything they could for you, and you must manage your own house.&#8221; The expenditure
on an average wedding is about fifteen or twenty rupees. A widow is usually taken in marriage by her late husband&#8217;s younger
brother or Dewar, or by one of his relatives. If she marries an outsider, the Dewar realises twelve rupees from him in compensation
for her loss. But if there is no Dewar this sum is not payable to her first husband&#8217;s elder brother or her own father, because
they could not have married her <a id="d0e6447"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6447">231</a>]</span>and hence are not held to be injured by a stranger doing so. If a woman is divorced and another man wishes to marry her, he
must make a similar payment of twelve rupees to the first husband, together with a goat and liquor for the penal feast. The
Bhainas bury or burn the dead according as their means permit.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6449">
<h3>5. Religious superstitions.</h3>
<p>Their principal deity in Bil&#257;spur is Nakti Devi<a id="d0e6454src" href="#d0e6454" class="noteref">3</a> or the &#8216;Noseless Goddess.&#8217; For her ritual rice is placed on a square of the floor washed with cowdung, and <i>gh&#299;</i> or preserved butter is poured on it and burnt. A hen is made to eat the rice, and then its head is cut off and laid on the
square. The liver is burnt on the fire as an offering to the deity and the head and body of the animal are then eaten. After
the death of a man a cock is offered to Nakti Devi and a hen after that of a woman. The fowl is made to pick rice first in
the yard of the house, then on the threshold, and lastly inside the house. Th&#257;kur Deo is the deity of cultivation and is worshipped
on the day before the autumn crops are sown. On this day all the men in the village go to his shrine taking a measure of rice
and a ploughshare. At the same time the Baiga or village priest goes and bathes in the tank and is afterwards carried to the
assembly on a man&#8217;s shoulders. Here he makes an offering and repeats a charm, and then kneeling down strikes the earth seven
times with the ploughshare, and sows five handfuls of rice, sprinkling water over the seed. After him the villagers walk seven
times round the altar of the god in pairs, one man turning up the earth with the ploughshare and the other sowing and watering
the seed. While this is going on the Baiga sits with his face covered with a piece of cloth, and at the end the villagers
salute the Baiga and go home. When a man wishes to do an injury to another he makes an image of him with clay and daubs it
with vermilion and worships it with an offering of a goat or a fowl and liquor. Then he prays the image that his enemy may
die. Another way of injuring an enemy is to take rice coloured with turmeric, and after <a id="d0e6460"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6460">232</a>]</span>muttering charms throw it in the direction in which the enemy lives.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6462">
<h3>6. Admission of outsiders and caste offences.</h3>
<p>Outsiders are not usually admitted, but if a Bhaina forms a connection with a woman of another tribe, they will admit the
children of such a union, though not the woman herself. For they say: &#8216;The seed is ours and what matters the field on which
it was sown.&#8217; But a man of the Kawar tribe having intimacy with a Bhaina woman may be taken into the community. He must wait
for three or four months after the matter becomes known and will beg for admission and offer to give the penalty feast. A
day is fixed for this and invitations are sent to members of the caste. On the appointed day the women of the tribe cook rice,
pulse, goat&#8217;s flesh and urad cakes fried in oil, and in the evening the people assemble and drink liquor and then go to take
their food. The candidate for admission serves water to the men and his prospective wife to the women, both being then permitted
to take food with the tribe. Next morning the people come again and the woman is dressed in a white cloth with bangles. The
couple stand together supported by their brother-in-law and sister-in-law respectively, and turmeric dissolved in water is
poured over their heads. They are now considered to be married and go round together and give the salutation or Joh&#257;r to the
people, touching the feet of those who are entitled to this mark of respect, and kissing the others. Among the offences for
which a man is temporarily put out of caste is getting the ear torn either accidentally or otherwise, being beaten by a man
of very low caste, growing san-hemp (<i>Crotalaria juncea</i>), rearing tasar silk-worms or getting maggots in a wound. This last is almost as serious an offence as killing a cow, and,
in both cases, before an offender can be reinstated he must kill a fowl and swallow a drop or two of its blood with turmeric.
Women commonly get the lobe of the ear torn through the heavy ear-rings which they wear; and in a squabble another woman will
often seize the ear-ring maliciously in order to tear the ear. A woman injured in this way is put out of caste for a year
in J&#257;njgir. To grow turmeric or garlic is also an offence against caste, but a man is permitted to do this for his own use
and not for sale. A man who gets leprosy is <a id="d0e6470"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6470">233</a>]</span>said to be permanently expelled from caste. The purification of delinquents is conducted by members of the Sonw&#257;ni (gold-water)
and Patel (headman) septs, whose business it is to give the offender water to drink in which gold has been dipped and to take
over the burden of his sins by first eating food with him. But others say that the H&#257;thi or elephant sept is the highest,
and to its members are delegated these duties. And in J&#257;njgir again the president of the committee gives the gold-water, and
is hence known as Sonw&#257;n; and this office must always be held by a man of the Bandar or monkey sept.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6472">
<h3>7. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The Bhainas are a comparatively civilised tribe and have largely adopted Hindu usages. They employ Br&#257;hmans to fix auspicious
days for their ceremonies, though not to officiate at them. They live principally in the open country and are engaged in agriculture,
though very few of them hold land and the bulk are farm-labourers. They now disclaim any connection with the primitive Baigas,
who still prefer the forests. But their caste mark, a symbol which may be affixed to documents in place of a signature or
used for a brand on cattle, is a bow, and this shows that they retain the recollection of hunting as their traditional occupation.
Like the Baigas, the tribe have forgotten their native dialect and now speak bad Hindi. They will eat pork and rats, and almost
anything else they can get, eschewing only beef. But in their intercourse with other castes they are absurdly strict, and
will take boiled rice only from a Kawar, or from a Br&#257;hman if it is cooked in a brass and not in an earthen vessel, and this
only from a male and not from a female Br&#257;hman; while they will accept baked <i>chap&#257;tis</i> and other food from a Gond and a R&#257;wat. But in Sambalpur they will take this from a Savar and not from a Gond. They rank
below the Gonds, Kawars and Savars or Saonrs. Women are tattooed with a representation of their sept totem; and on the knees
and ankles they have some figures of lines which are known as <i>gh&#257;ts</i>. These they say will enable them to climb the mountains leading to heaven in the other world, while those who have not such
marks will be pierced with spears on their way up the ascent. It has already been suggested that these marks may have given
rise to the name of the Ghaty&#257;ra division of the tribe.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6487">
<h3>1. Occupation.</h3>
<p><b>Bh&#257;mta or Bh&#257;mtya.</b><a id="d0e6493src" href="#d0e6493" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A caste numbering 4000 persons in the Central Provinces, nearly all of whom reside in the Wardha, N&#257;gpur and Ch&#257;nda Districts
of the N&#257;gpur Division. The Bh&#257;mtas are also found in Bombay, Ber&#257;r and Hyder&#257;b&#257;d. In Bombay they are known by the names of
Uchla or &#8216;Lifter&#8217; and Ganthachor or &#8216;Bundle-thief.&#8217;<a id="d0e6496src" href="#d0e6496" class="noteref">2</a> The Bh&#257;mtas were and still are notorious thieves, but many of the caste are now engaged in the cultivation of hemp, from
which they make ropes, mats and gunny-bags. Formerly it was said in Wardha that a Bh&#257;mta girl would not marry unless her suitor
had been arrested not less than fourteen times by the police, when she considered that he had qualified as a man. The following
description of their methods does not necessarily apply to the whole caste, though the bulk of them are believed to have criminal
tendencies. But some colonies of Bh&#257;mtas who have taken to the manufacture of sacking and gunny-bags from hemp-fibre may perhaps
be excepted. They steal only during the daytime, and divide that part of the Province which they frequent into regular beats
or ranges. They adopt many disguises. Even in their own cottages one dresses as a M&#257;rw&#257;ri Bania, another as a Gujar&#257;t Jain,
a third as a Br&#257;hman and a fourth as a R&#257;jp&#363;t. They keep to some particular disguise for years and often travel hundreds of
miles, entering and stealing from the houses of the classes of persons whose dress they adopt, or taking service with a merchant
or trader, and having gained their employer&#8217;s confidence, seizing an opportunity to abscond with some valuable property. Sometimes
two or three Bh&#257;mtas visit a large fair, and one of them dressed as a Br&#257;hman mingles with the crowd of bathers and worshippers.
The false Br&#257;hman notices some ornament deposited by a bather, and while himself entering the water and repeating sacred verses,
watches his opportunity and spreads out his cloth near the ornament, which he then catches with his toes, and dragging it
with him to a distance as he walks away buries <a id="d0e6501"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6501">235</a>]</span>it in the sand. The accomplices meanwhile loiter near, and when the owner discovers his loss the Br&#257;hman sympathises with
him and points out the accomplices as likely thieves, thus diverting suspicion from himself. The victim follows the accomplices,
who make off, and the real thief meanwhile digs the ornament out of the sand and escapes at his leisure. Women often tie their
ornaments in bundles at such bathing-fairs, and in that case two Bh&#257;mtas will go up to her, one on each side, and while one
distracts her attention the other makes off with the bundle and buries it in the sand. A Bh&#257;mta rarely retains the stolen
property on his person while there is a chance of his being searched, and is therefore not detected. They show considerable
loyalty to one another, and never steal from or give information against a member of the caste. If stolen property is found
in a Bh&#257;mta&#8217;s house, and it has merely been deposited there for security, the real thief comes forward. An escaped prisoner
does not come back to his friends lest he should get them into trouble. A Bh&#257;mta is never guilty of house-breaking or gang-robbery,
and if he takes part in this offence he is put out of caste. He does not steal from the body of a person asleep. He is, however,
expert at the theft of ornaments from the person. He never steals from a house in his own village, and the villagers frequently
share directly or indirectly in his gains. The Bh&#257;mtas are now expert railway thieves.<a id="d0e6503src" href="#d0e6503" class="noteref">3</a> Two of them will get into a carriage, and, engaging the other passengers in conversation, find out where they are going,
so as to know the time available for action. When it gets dark and the travellers go to sleep, one of the Bh&#257;mtas lies down
on the floor and covers himself with a large cloth. He begins feeling some bag under the seat, and if he cannot open it with
his hands, takes from his mouth the small curved knife which all Bh&#257;mtas carry concealed between their gum and upper lip,
and with this he rips up the seams of the bag and takes out what he finds; or they exchange bags, according to a favourite
device of English railway thieves, and then quickly either leave the train or get into another carriage. <a id="d0e6509"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6509">236</a>]</span>If attention is aroused they throw the stolen property out of the window, marking the place and afterwards going back to recover
it. Another device is to split open and pick the pockets of people in a crowd. Besides the knife they often have a needle
and thread and an iron nut-cutter.

<h3>2. Subdivisions and marriage customs.</h3>
<p>Members of other castes, as Chhatri, Kanjar, R&#257;wat and others, who have taken to stealing, are frequently known as Bh&#257;mtas,
but unless they have been specially initiated do not belong to the caste. The Bh&#257;mtas proper have two main divisions, the
Chhatri Bh&#257;mtas, who are usually immigrants from Gujar&#257;t, and those of the Mar&#257;tha country, who are often known as Bh&#257;mtis.
The former have a dialect which is a mixture of Hindi, Mar&#257;thi and Gujar&#257;ti, while the latter speak the local form of Mar&#257;thi.
The sections of the Chhatri Bh&#257;mtas are named after R&#257;jp&#363;t septs, as Badg&#363;jar, Chauh&#257;n, Gahlot, Bhatti, Kachhw&#257;ha and others.
They may be partly of R&#257;jp&#363;t descent, as they have regular and pleasing features and a fair complexion, and are well built
and sturdy. The sections of the Bh&#257;mtis are called by Mar&#257;tha surnames, as Gudekar, Kaothi, Bailkhade, S&#257;tbhaia and others.
The Chhatri Bh&#257;mtas have northern customs, and the Bh&#257;mtis those of the Mar&#257;tha country. Marriage between persons of the same
<i>gotra</i> or surname is prohibited. The Chhatris avoid marriage between relations having a common greatgrandparent, but among the Bh&#257;mtis
the custom of Mehunch&#257;r is prevalent, by which the brother&#8217;s daughter is married to the sister&#8217;s son. Girls are usually married
at ten and eleven years of age or later. The betrothal and marriage customs of the two subcastes differ, the Chhatris following
the ceremonial of the northern Districts and the Bh&#257;mtis that of the Mar&#257;tha country. The Chhatris do not pay a bride-price,
but the Bh&#257;mtis usually do. Widow-marriage is allowed, and while the Chhatris expect the widow to marry her deceased husband&#8217;s
brother, the Bh&#257;mtis do not permit this. Among both subdivisions a price is paid for the widow to her parents. Divorce is
only permitted for immoral conduct on the part of the wife. A divorced woman may remarry after giving a feast to the caste
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee, and obtaining their consent.

<h3>3. Religion and social customs.</h3>
<p>The goddess Devi is the tutelary deity of the caste, as of all those who ply a disreputable profession. Animals are sacrificed
to her or let loose to wander in her name. The offerings are appropriated by the village washerman. In Bombay the rendezvous
of the Bh&#257;mtis is the temple of Devi at Konali, in Akalkot State, near Sholapur, and here the gangs frequently assemble before
and after their raids to ask the goddess that luck may attend them and to thank her for success obtained.<a id="d0e6529src" href="#d0e6529" class="noteref">4</a> They worship their rope-making implements on the Dasahra day. They both bury and burn the dead. Ghosts and spirits are worshipped.
If a man takes a second wife after the death of his first, the new wife wears a <i>putli</i> or image of the first wife on a piece of silver on her neck, and offers it the <i>hom</i> sacrifice by placing some <i>gh&#299;</i> on the fire before taking a meal. In cases of doubt and difficulty she often consults the <i>putli</i> by speaking to it, while any chance stir of the image due to the movement of her body is interpreted as approval or disapproval.
In the Central Provinces the Bh&#257;mtis say that they do not admit outsiders into the caste, but this is almost certainly untrue.
In Bombay they are said to admit all Hindus<a id="d0e6546src" href="#d0e6546" class="noteref">5</a> except the very lowest castes, and also Muhammadans. The candidate must pass through the two ceremonies of admission into
the caste and adoption into a particular family. For the first he pays an admission fee, is bathed and dressed in new clothes,
and one of the elders drops turmeric and sugar into his mouth. A feast follows, during which some elders of the caste eat
out of the same plate with him. This completes the admission ceremony, but in order to marry in the caste a candidate must
also be adopted into a particular family. The Bh&#257;mta who has agreed to adopt him invites the caste people to his house, and
there takes the candidate on his knee while the guests drop turmeric and sugar into his mouth. The Bh&#257;mtas eat fish and fowl
but not pork or beef, and drink liquor. This last practice is, however, frequently made a caste offence by the Bh&#257;mtis. They
take cooked food from Br&#257;hmans and Kunbis and water from Gonds. The keeping of concubines is also an offence entailing temporary
excommunication. <a id="d0e6551"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6551">238</a>]</span>The morality of the caste is somewhat low and their women are addicted to prostitution. The occupation of the Bh&#257;mta is also
looked down on, and it is said, <i>Bh&#257;mta ka k&#257;m sub se nik&#257;m</i>, or &#8216;The Bh&#257;mta&#8217;s work is the worst of all.&#8217; This may apply either to his habits of stealing or to the fact that he supplies
a bier made of twine and bamboo sticks at a death. In Bombay the showy dress of the Bh&#257;mta is proverbial. Women are tattooed
before marriage on the forehead and lower lip, and on other parts of the body for purposes of adornment. The men have the
head shaved for three inches above the top of the forehead in front and an inch higher behind, and they wear the scalp-lock
much thicker than Br&#257;hmans do. They usually have red head-cloths.

<div class="div2" id="d0e6559">
<h3>1. General notice</h3>
<p><b>Bharbh&#363;nja.</b><a id="d0e6565src" href="#d0e6565" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;The occupational caste of grain-parchers. The name is derived from the Sanskrit <i>bhr&#257;stra</i>, a frying-pan, and <i>bh&#257;rjaka</i>, one who fries. The Bharbh&#363;njas numbered 3000 persons in 1911, and belong mainly to the northern Districts, their headquarters
being in Upper India. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the place of the Bharbh&#363;njas is taken by the Dh&#363;ris. Sir H. Elliot<a id="d0e6574src" href="#d0e6574" class="noteref">2</a> remarks that the caste are traditionally supposed to be descended from a Kah&#257;r father and a S&#363;dra mother, and they are probably
connected with the Kah&#257;rs. In Saugor they say that their ancestors were K&#257;nkubja Br&#257;hmans who were ordered to parch rice at
the wedding of the great R&#257;ma, and in consequence of this one of their subcastes is known as K&#257;nbajia. But K&#257;nkubja is one
of the commonest names of subcastes among the people of northern India, and merely indicates that the bearers belong to the
tract round the old city of Kanauj; and there is no reason to suppose that it means anything more in the case of the Bharbh&#363;njas.
Another group are called Kaitha, and they say that their ancestors were K&#257;yasths, who adopted the profession of grain-parching.
It is said that in Bhop&#257;l proper K&#257;yasths will take food from Kaitha Bharbh&#363;njas and smoke from their huqqa; and it is noticeable
that in <a id="d0e6579"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6579">239</a>]</span>northern India Mr. Crooke gives<a id="d0e6581src" href="#d0e6581" class="noteref">3</a> not only the Kaitha subcaste, but other groups called Saksena and Sriv&#257;stab, which are the names of well-known Kayasth subdivisions.
It is possible, therefore, that the Kaitha group may really be connected with the K&#257;yasths. Other subcastes are the Bengl&#257;h,
who are probably immigrants from Bengal; and the K&#257;ndu, who may also come from that direction, K&#257;ndu being the name of the
corresponding caste of grain-parchers in Bengal.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6586">
<h3>2. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The social customs of the Bharbh&#363;njas resemble those of Hindust&#257;ni castes of fairly good position.<a id="d0e6591src" href="#d0e6591" class="noteref">4</a> They employ Br&#257;hmans for their ceremonies, and the family priest receives five rupees for officiating at a wedding, three
rupees for a funeral, one rupee for a birth, and four annas on ordinary occasions. No price is paid for a bride, and at their
marriages the greater part of the expense falls on the girl&#8217;s father, who has to give three feasts as against two provided
by the bridegroom&#8217;s father. After the wedding the bridegroom&#8217;s father puts on women&#8217;s clothes given by the bride&#8217;s father
and dances before the family. Rose-coloured water and powder are sprinkled over the guests and the proceeding is known as
<i>Ph&#257;g</i>, because it is considered to have the same significance as the Holi festival observed in Ph&#257;gun. This is usually done on
the bank of a river or in some garden outside the village. At the <i>gauna</i> or going-away ceremony the bride and bridegroom take their seats on two wooden boards and then change places. Divorce and
the remarriage of widows are permitted. The union of a widow with her deceased husband&#8217;s younger brother is considered a suitable
match, but is not compulsory. When a bachelor marries a widow, he first goes through the proper ceremony either with a stick
or an ear-ring, and is then united to the widow by the simple ritual employed for widow remarriage. A girl who is seduced
by a member of the caste may be married to him as if she were a widow, but if her lover is an outsider she is permanently
expelled from the caste.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6600">
<h3>3. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The Bharbh&#363;njas occupy a fairly high social position, <a id="d0e6605"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6605">240</a>]</span>analogous to that of the Barais, Kah&#257;rs and other serving castes, the explanation being that all Hindus require the grain
parched by them; this, as it is not cooked with water, may be eaten abroad, on a journey or in the market-place. This is known
as <i>pakki</i> food, and even Br&#257;hmans will take it from their hands. But Mr. Crooke notes<a id="d0e6610src" href="#d0e6610" class="noteref">5</a> that the work they do, and particularly the sweeping up of dry leaves for fuel, tends to lower them in the popular estimation,
and it is a favourite curse to wish of an enemy that he may some day come to stoke the kiln of a grain-parcher. Of their occupation
Sir H. Risley states that &#8220;Throughout the caste the actual work of parching grain is usually left to the women. The process
is a simple one. A clay oven is built, somewhat in the shape of a bee-hive, with ten or twelve round holes at the top. A fire
is lighted under it and broken earthen pots containing sand are put on the holes. The grain to be parched is thrown in with
the sand and stirred with a flat piece of wood or a broom until it is ready. The sand and parched grain are then placed in
a sieve, through which the former escapes. The wages of the parcher are a proportion of the grain, varying from one-eighth
to one-fourth. In Bengal the caste was spoken of by early English travellers under the quaint name of the frymen.&#8221;<a id="d0e6614src" href="#d0e6614" class="noteref">6</a> In the Central Provinces also grain-parching is distinctly a woman&#8217;s industry, only twenty-two per cent of those shown as
working at it being men. There are two classes of tradesmen, those who simply keep ovens and parch grain which is brought
to them, and those who keep the grain and sell it ready parched. The rates for parching are a pice a seer or an eighth part
of the grain. Gram and rice, husked or unhusked, are the grains usually parched. When parched, gram is called <i>phut&#257;na</i> (broken) and rice <i>l&#257;hi</i>. The Bharbh&#363;njas also prepare <i>sathu</i>, a flour made by grinding parched gram or wheat, which is a favourite food for a light morning meal, or for travellers. It
can be taken without preparation, being simply mixed with water and a little salt or sugar. The following story is told about
<i>sathu</i> to emphasise its convenience in this respect. Once two travellers were about to take some food before <a id="d0e6631"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6631">241</a>]</span>starting in the morning, of whom one had <i>sathu</i> and the other <i>dh&#257;n</i> (unhusked rice). The one with the <i>dh&#257;n</i> knew that it would take him a long time to pound, and then cook and eat it, so he said to the other, &#8220;My poor friend, I perceive
that you only have <i>sathu</i>, which will delay you because you must find water, and then mix it, and find salt, and put it in, before your <i>sathu</i> can be ready, while rice&#8212;pound, eat and go. But if you like, as you are in a greater hurry than I am, I will change my rice
for your <i>sathu</i>.&#8221; The other traveller unsuspectingly consented, thinking he was getting the best of the bargain, and while he was still looking
for a mortar in which to pound his rice, the first traveller had mixed and eaten the <i>sathu</i> and proceeded on his journey. In the vernacular the point is brought out by the onomatopoeic character of the lines, which
cannot be rendered in English. The caste are now also engaged in selling tobacco and sweetmeats and the manufacture of fireworks.
They stoke their ovens with any refuse they can collect from the roads, and hence comes the saying, &#8216;<i lang="und">Bh&#257;r men d&#257;lna</i>&#8217;, &#8216;To throw into the oven,&#8217; meaning to throw away something or to make ducks and drakes with it; while <i>Bh&#257;r-jhokna</i> signifies to light or heat the oven, and, figuratively, to take up a mean occupation (Platts). Another proverb quoted by
Mr. Crooke is, &#8216;<i lang="und">Bharbh&#363;nja ka larki kesar ka t&#299;ka</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;The Bharbh&#363;nja&#8217;s slut with saffron on her forehead,&#8217; meaning one dressed in borrowed plumes. Another saying is, &#8216;<i lang="und">To tum kya abhi tak bh&#257;r bhunjte rahe</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;Have you been stoking the oven all this time?&#8217;&#8212;meaning to imply that the person addressed has been wasting his time,
because the profits from grain-parching are so small. The oven of the Psalmist into which the grass was cast no doubt closely
resembled that of the Bharbh&#363;njas.

<h3>1. Origin and tribal legend.</h3>
<p><b>Bharia, Bharia-Bhumia.</b><a id="d0e6719src" href="#d0e6719" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A Dravidian tribe numbering about 50,000 persons and residing principally in the Jubbulpore District, which contains a half
of the total number. The others are found in Chhindw&#257;ra and Bil&#257;spur. The proper name of the tribe is Bharia, but they are
often called Bharia-Bhumia, because many of them hold the office of Bhumia or priest of the village gods and of the lower
castes in Jubbulpore, and the Bharias prefer the designation of Bhumia as being the more respectable. The term Bhumia or &#8216;Lord
of the soil&#8217; is an alternative for Bhuiya, the name of another Dravidian tribe, and no doubt came to be applied to the office
of village priest because it was held by members of this tribe; the term Baiga has a similar signification in Mandla and B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t,
and is applied to the village priest though he may not belong to the Baiga tribe at all. The Bharias have forgotten their
original affinities, and several stories of the origin of the tribe are based on far-fetched derivations of the name. One
of these is to the effect that Arjun, when matters were going badly with the Pandavas in their battle against the Kauravas,
took up a handful of <i>bharru</i> grass and, pressing it, produced a host of men who fought in the battle and became the ancestors of <a id="d0e6725"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6725">243</a>]</span>the Bharias. And there are others of the same historical value. But there is no reason to doubt that Bharia is the contemptuous
form of Bhar, as Telia for Teli, Jugia for Jogi, Kuria for Kori, and that the Bharias belong to the great Bhar tribe who were
once dominant in the eastern part of the United Provinces, but are now at the bottom of the social scale, and relegated by
their conquerors to the degrading office of swineherds. The R&#257;jjhars, who appear to have formed a separate caste as the landowning
subdivision of the Bhars, like the R&#257;j-Gonds among Gonds, are said to be the descendants of a R&#257;ja and a Bharia woman. The
R&#257;jjhars form a separate caste in the Central Provinces, and the Bharias acknowledge some connection with them, but refuse
to take water from their hands, as they consider them to be of impure blood. The Bharias also give Mahoba or B&#257;ndhogarh as
their former home, and these places are in the country of the Bhars. According to tradition R&#257;ja Karna Deva, a former king
of D&#257;hal, the classical name of the Jubbulpore country, was a Bhar, and it may be that the immigration of the Bharias into
Jubbulpore dates from his period, which is taken as 1040 to 1080 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> While then it may be considered as fairly certain that the Bharias are merely the Bhar tribe with a variant of the name,
it is clear from the titles of their family groups, which will shortly be given, that they are an extremely mixed class and
consist largely of the descendants of members of other castes, who, having lost their own social position, have taken refuge
among the Bharias at the bottom of the social scale. Mr. Crooke says of the Bhars:<a id="d0e6730src" href="#d0e6730" class="noteref">2</a> &#8220;The most probable supposition is that the Bhars were a Dravidian race closely allied to the Kols, Cheros and Seoris, who
at an early date succumbed to the invading Aryans. This is borne out by their appearance and physique, which closely resemble
that of the undoubted non-Aryan aborigines of the Vindhyan-Kaim&#363;r plateau.&#8221; In the Central Provinces the Bharias have been
so closely associated with the Gonds that they have been commonly considered to belong to that tribe. Thus Mr. Drysdale says
of them:<a id="d0e6735src" href="#d0e6735" class="noteref">3</a> &#8216;The Bharias were the wildest of the wild Gonds <a id="d0e6740"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6740">244</a>]</span>and were inveterate <i>dhay&#257;</i><a id="d0e6744src" href="#d0e6744" class="noteref">4</a> cutters.&#8217; Although, however, they have to some extent intermarried with the Gonds, the Bharias were originally quite a distinct
tribe, and would belong to the Kolarian or Munda group but that they have entirely forgotten their own language and speak
only Hindi, though with a peculiar intonation especially noticeable in the case of their women.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6749">
<h3>2. Tribal subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The structure of the tribe is a very loose one, and though the Bharias say that they are divided into subcastes, there are
none in reality. Members of all castes except the very lowest may become Bharias, and one Bharia will recognise another as
a fellow-tribesman if he can show relationship to any person admitted to occupy that position. But a division is in process
of formation in Bil&#257;spur based on the practice of eating beef, from which some abstain, and in consequence look down on the
others who are addicted to it, and call them Dhur Bharias, the term <i>dhur</i> meaning cattle. The abstainers from beef now refuse to marry with the others. The tribe is divided into a number of exogamous
groups, and the names of these indicate the very heterogeneous elements of which it consists. Out of fifty-one groups reported
not less than fifteen or sixteen have names derived from other castes or clans, showing almost certainly that such groups
were formed by a mixed marriage or the admission of a family of outsiders. Such names are: Agaria, from the Agarias or iron-workers:
this clan worships Loha-Sur, the god of the Agarias; Ahirw&#257;r, or the descendants of an Ah&#299;r: this clan worships the Ah&#299;r gods;
Bamhania, born of a Br&#257;hman ancestor; Binjhw&#257;r or Binjha, perhaps from the tribe of that name; Chandel, from a R&#257;jp&#363;t clan;
Dagdoha, a synonym of Basor: persons of this sept hang a piece of bamboo and a curved knife to the waist of the bride at their
marriages; Dhurua, born of a Dhurua Gond; Ku&#257;npa, born of an Ah&#299;r subcaste of that name; Kurka, of Korku parentage; Mar&#257;vi,
the name of a Gond clan; R&#257;thor from a R&#257;jp&#363;t clan; Samarba from a Cham&#257;r; and Yarkara, the name of a Gond clan. These names
sufficiently indicate the diverse elements of which the tribe is made up. Other <a id="d0e6757"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6757">245</a>]</span>group names with meanings are: Gambhele, or those who seclude their women in a separate house during the menstrual period;
Kaitha, from the <i>kaith</i> tree (<i>Feronia elephantum</i>); Karondiha, from the <i>karonda</i> plant (<i>Carissa Carandas</i>); Magarha, from <i>magar</i> a crocodile: members of this group worship an image of a crocodile made with flour and fried in oil; Sonw&#257;ni, from <i>sona</i> gold: members of this group perform the ceremony of readmission of persons temporarily put out of caste by sprinkling on
them a little water in which gold has been dipped. Any person who does not know his clan name calls himself a Chandel, and
this group, though bearing the name of a distinguished R&#257;jp&#363;t clan, is looked upon as the lowest. But although the rule of
exogamy in marriage is recognised, it is by no means strictly adhered to, and many cases are known in which unions have taken
place between members of the same clan. So long as people can recollect a relationship between themselves, they do not permit
their families to intermarry. But the memory of the Bharia does not extend beyond the third generation.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6777">
<h3>3. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Marriages are adult, and the proposal comes from the boy&#8217;s father, who has it conveyed to the girl&#8217;s father through some friend
in his village. If a betrothal is arranged the bride&#8217;s father invites the father and friends of the bridegroom to dinner;
on this occasion the boy&#8217;s father brings some necklaces of lac beads and spangles and presents them to the bride&#8217;s female
relatives, who then come out and tie the necklaces round his neck and those of his friends, place the spangles on their foreheads,
and then, catching hold of their cheeks, press and twist them violently. Some turmeric powder is also thrown on their faces.
This is the binding portion of the betrothal ceremony. The date of marriage is fixed by a Br&#257;hman, this being the only purpose
for which he is employed, and a bride-price varying from six to twelve rupees is paid. On this occasion the women draw caricatures
with turmeric or charcoal on the loin-cloth of the boy&#8217;s father, which they manage to purloin. The marriage ceremony follows
generally the Hindu form. The bridegroom puts on women&#8217;s ornaments and carries with him an iron nut-cracker or dagger to keep
off evil spirits. After <a id="d0e6782"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6782">246</a>]</span>the wedding, the <i>midua</i>, a sort of burlesque dance, is held. The girl&#8217;s mother gets the dress of the boy&#8217;s father and puts it on, together with a
false beard and moustaches, and dances, holding a wooden ladle in one hand and a packet of ashes in the other. Every time
she approaches the bridegroom&#8217;s father on her rounds she spills some of the ashes over him, and occasionally gives him a crack
on the head with her ladle, these actions being accompanied by bursts of laughter from the party and frenzied playing by the
musicians. When the party reach the bridegroom&#8217;s house on their return, his mother and the other women come out and burn a
little mustard and human hair in a lamp, the unpleasant smell emitted by these articles being considered potent to drive away
evil spirits. Every time the bride leaves her father&#8217;s house she must weep, and must cry separately with each one of her caste-sisters
when taking leave of them. When she returns home she must begin weeping loudly on the boundary of the village, and continue
doing so until she has embraced each of her relatives and friends, a performance which in a village containing a large number
of Bharias may take from three to six hours. These tears are, however, considered to be a manifestation of joy, and the girl
who cannot produce enough of them is often ridiculed. A prospective son-in-law who serves for his wife is known as Gharji&#257;n.
The work given him is always very heavy, and the Bharias have a saying which compares his treatment with that awarded to an
ox obtained on hire. If a girl is seduced by a man of the tribe, she may be married to him by the ceremony prescribed for
the remarriage of a widow, which consists merely in the placing of bangles on the wrists and a present of a new cloth, together
with a feast to the caste-fellows. Similarly if she is seduced by a man of another caste who would be allowed to become a
Bharia, she can be married as a widow to any man of the tribe. A widow is expected to marry her late husband&#8217;s younger brother,
but no compulsion is exercised. If a bachelor espouses a widow, he first goes through the ceremony of marriage with a ring
to which a twig of the date-palm is tied, by carrying the ring seven times round the marriage post. This is necessary to save
him from the sin of dying <a id="d0e6787"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6787">247</a>]</span>unmarried, as the union with a widow is not reckoned as a true marriage. In Jubbulpore divorce is said to be allowed only
for conjugal misbehaviour, and a Bharia will pass over three transgressions on his wife&#8217;s part before finally turning her
out of his house. A woman who wishes to leave her husband simply runs away from him and lives with somebody else. In this
case the third party must pay a goat to the husband by way of compensation and give a feast to the caste-fellows.

<h3>4. Childbirth.</h3>
<p>The carelessness of the Bharias in the matter of childbirth is notorious, and it is said that mothers commonly went on working
up to the moment of childbirth and were delivered of children in the fields. Now, however, the woman lies up for three days,
and some ceremonies of purification are performed. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh infants are branded on the day of their birth, under the
impression that this will cause them to digest the food they have taken in the womb. The child is named six months after birth
by the father&#8217;s sister, and its lips are then touched with cooked food for the first time.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6794">
<h3>5. Funeral ceremonies.</h3>
<p>The tribe both burn and bury the dead, and observe mourning for an adult for ten days, during which time they daily put out
a leaf-cup containing food for the use of the deceased. In the third year after the death, the <i>mangan</i> or caste beggar visits the relatives of the deceased, and receives what they call one limb (<i>ang</i>), or half his belongings; the <i>ang</i> consists of a loin-cloth, a brass vessel and dish, an axe, a scythe and a wrist-ring.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6808">
<h3>6. Religion and magic.</h3>
<p>The Bharias call themselves Hindus and worship the village deities of the locality, and on the day of Diw&#257;li offer a black
chicken to their family god, who may be Bura Deo, D&#363;lha Deo or Karua, the cobra. For this snake they profess great reverence,
and say that he was actually born in a Bharia family. As he could not work in the fields he was usually employed on errands.
One day he was sent to the house, and surprised one of his younger brother&#8217;s wives, who had not heard him coming, without
her veil. She reproached him, and he retired in dudgeon to the oven, where he was presently burnt to death by another woman,
who kindled a fire under it not knowing that he was there. So he has <a id="d0e6813"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6813">248</a>]</span>been deified and is worshipped by the tribe. The Bharias also venerate B&#257;gheshwar, the tiger god, and believe that no tiger
will eat a Bharia. On the Diw&#257;li day they invite the tiger to drink some gruel which they place ready for him behind their
houses, at the same time warning the other villagers not to stir out of doors. In the morning they display the empty vessels
as a proof that the tiger has visited them. They practise various magical devices, believing that they can kill a man by discharging
at him a <i>m&#363;th</i> or handful of charmed objects such as lemons, vermilion and seeds of urad. This ball will travel through the air and, descending
on the house of the person at whom it is aimed, will kill him outright unless he can avert its power by stronger magic, and
perhaps even cause it to recoil in the same manner on the head of the sender. They exorcise the Sudhiniyas or the drinkers
of human blood. A person troubled by one of these is seated near the Bharia, who places two pots with their mouths joined
over a fire. He recites incantations and the pots begin to boil, emitting blood. This result is obtained by placing a herb
in the pot whose juice stains the water red. The blood-sucker is thus successfully exorcised. To drive away the evil eye they
burn a mixture of chillies, salt, human hair and the husks of kodon, which emits a very evil smell. Such devices are practised
by members of the tribe who hold the office of Bhumia or village priest. The Bharias are well-known thieves, and they say
that the dark spots on the moon are caused by a banyan tree, which God planted with the object of diminishing her light and
giving thieves a chance to ply their trade. If a Bhumia wishes to detect a thief, he sits clasping hands with a friend, while
a pitcher is supported on their hands. An oblation is offered to the deity to guide the ordeal correctly, and the names of
suspected persons are recited one by one, the name at which the pitcher topples over being that of the thief. But before employing
this method of detection the Bhumia proclaims his intention of doing so on a certain date, and in the meantime places a heap
of ashes in some lonely place and invites the thief to deposit the stolen article in the ashes to save himself from exposure.
By common custom each person in the village is required to visit <a id="d0e6818"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6818">249</a>]</span>the heap and mingle a handful of ashes with it, and not infrequently the thief, frightened at the Bhumia&#8217;s powers of detection,
takes the stolen article and buries it in the ash-heap where it is duly found, the necessity for resorting to the further
method of divination being thus obviated. Occasionally the Bharia in his character of a Hindu will make a vow to pay for a
recitation of the Satya N&#257;r&#257;yan Katha or some other holy work. But he understands nothing of it, and if the Br&#257;hman employed
takes a longer time than he had bargained for over the recitation he becomes extremely bored and irritated.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6820">
<h3>7. Social life and customs.</h3>
<p>The scantiness of the Bharia&#8217;s dress is proverbial, and the saying is &#8216;<i lang="und">Bharia bhw&#257;ka, pw&#257;nda langw&#257;ta</i>&#8217;, or &#8216;The Bharia is verily a devil, who only covers his loins with a strip of cloth.&#8217; But lately he has assumed more clothing.
Formerly an iron ring carried on the wrist to exorcise the evil spirits was his only ornament. Women wear usually only one
coarse cloth dyed red, spangles on the forehead and ears, bead necklaces, and cheap metal bracelets and anklets. Some now
have Hindu ornaments, but in common with other low castes they do not usually wear a nose-ring, out of respect to the higher
castes. Women, though they work in the fields, do not commonly wear shoes; and if these are necessary to protect the feet
from thorns, they take them off and carry them in the presence of an elder or a man of higher caste. They are tattooed with
various devices, as a cock, a crown, a native chair, a pitcher stand, a sieve and a figure called <i>dhandha</i>, which consists of six dots joined by lines, and appears to be a representation of a man, one dot standing for the head,
one for the body, two for the arms and two for the legs. This device is also used by other castes, and they evince reluctance
if asked to explain its meaning, so that it may be intended as a representation of the girl&#8217;s future husband. The Bharia is
considered very ugly, and a saying about him is: &#8216;The Bharia came down from the hills and got burnt by a cinder, so that his
face is black.&#8217; He does not bathe for months together, and lives in a dirty hovel, infested by the fowls which he loves to
rear. His food consists of coarse grain, often with boiled leaves as a vegetable, and he consumes much whey, mixing it with
his scanty portion of <a id="d0e6831"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6831">250</a>]</span>grain. Members of all except the lowest castes are admitted to the Bharia community on presentation of a <i>pagri</i> and some money to the headman, together with a feast to the caste-fellows. The Bharias do not eat monkeys, beef or the leavings
of others, but they freely consume fowls and pork. They are not considered as impure, but rank above those castes only whose
touch conveys pollution. For the slaughter of a cow the Bil&#257;spur Bharias inflict the severe punishment of nine daily feasts
to the caste, or one for each limb of the cow, the limbs being held to consist of the legs, ears, horns and tail. They have
an aversion for the horse and will not remove its dung. To account for this they tell a story to the effect that in the beginning
God gave them a horse to ride and fight upon. But they did not know how to mount the horse because it was so high. The wisest
man among them then proposed to cut notches in the side of the animal by which they could climb up, and they did this. But
God, when he saw it, was very angry with them, and ordered that they should never be soldiers, but should be given a winnowing-fan
and broom to sweep the grain out of the grass and make their livelihood in that way.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6836">
<h3>8. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The Bharias are usually farmservants and field-labourers, and their services in these capacities are in much request. They
are hardy and industrious, and so simple that it is an easy matter for their masters to involve them in perpetual debt, and
thus to keep them bound to service from generation to generation. They have no understanding of accounts, and the saying,
&#8216;Pay for the marriage of a Bharia and he is your bond-slave for ever,&#8217; sufficiently explains the methods adopted by their
employers and creditors.

<h3>1. Origin of the Bh&#257;ts.</h3>
<p><b>Bh&#257;t, Rao, Jasondhi.</b>&#8212;The caste of bards and genealogists. In 1911 the Bh&#257;ts numbered 29,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r, being
distributed over all Districts and States, with a slight preponderance in large towns such as N&#257;gpur, Jubbulpore and Amraoti.
The name Bh&#257;t is derived from the Sanskrit Bhatta, a lord. The origin of the Bh&#257;ts has been discussed in detail by Sir H.
Risley. Some, no doubt, are derived from the Br&#257;hman caste as stated by Mr. Nesfield: &#8220;They are an offshoot from those secularised
Br&#257;hmans who frequented the courts of princes and the camps of warriors, recited their praises in public, and kept records
of their genealogies. Such, without much variation, is the function of the Bh&#257;t at the present day. The Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata speaks
of a band of bards and eulogists marching in front of Yudishthira as he made his progress from the field of Kurukshetra towards
Hastinapur. But these very men are spoken of in the same poem as Br&#257;hmans. Naturally as time went on these courtier priests
became hereditary bards, receded from the parent stem and founded a new caste.&#8221; &#8220;The best modern opinion,&#8221; Sir H. <a id="d0e6940"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6940">252</a>]</span>Risley states,<a id="d0e6942src" href="#d0e6942" class="noteref">1</a> &#8220;seems disposed to find the germ of the Br&#257;hman caste in the bards, ministers and family priests, who were attached to the
king&#8217;s household in Vedic times. The characteristic profession of the Bh&#257;ts has an ancient and distinguished history. The
literature of both Greece and India owes the preservation of its oldest treasures to the singers who recited poems in the
households of the chiefs, and doubtless helped in some measure to shape the masterpieces which they handed down. Their place
was one of marked distinction. In the days when writing was unknown, the man who could remember many verses was held in high
honour by the tribal chief, who depended upon the memory of the bard for his personal amusement, for the record of his own
and his ancestors&#8217; prowess, and for the maintenance of the genealogy which established the purity of his descent. The bard,
like the herald, was not lightly to be slain, and even Odysseus in the heat of his vengeance spares the <span class="abbr" title="Transcription: aoidos"><span class="Greek" lang="el">&#7936;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#8057;&#962;</span></span> Phemius, &#8216;who sang among the wooers of necessity.&#8217;&#8221;<a id="d0e6951src" href="#d0e6951" class="noteref">2</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6954">
<h3>2. Bh&#257;ts and Ch&#257;rans.</h3>
<p>There is no reason to doubt that the Birm or Baram Bh&#257;ts are an offshoot of Br&#257;hmans, their name being merely a corruption
of the term Br&#257;hman. But the caste is a very mixed one, and another large section, the Ch&#257;rans, are almost certainly derived
from R&#257;jp&#363;ts. Malcolm states that according to the fable of their origin, Mah&#257;deo first created Bh&#257;ts to attend his lion and
bull; but these could not prevent the former from killing the latter, which was a source of infinite vexation and trouble,
as it compelled Mah&#257;deo to create new ones. He therefore formed the Ch&#257;ran, equally devout with the Bh&#257;t, but of bolder spirit,
and gave him in charge these favourite animals. From that time no bull was ever destroyed by the lion.<a id="d0e6959src" href="#d0e6959" class="noteref">3</a> This fable perhaps indicates that while the peaceful Bh&#257;ts were Br&#257;hmans, the more warlike Ch&#257;rans were R&#257;jp&#363;ts. It is also
said that some R&#257;jp&#363;ts disguised themselves as bards to escape the vengeance of Parasur&#257;ma.<a id="d0e6965src" href="#d0e6965" class="noteref">4</a> The M&#257;ru Ch&#257;rans intermarry with R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and their name appears to be derived from M&#257;ru, the term for the R&#257;jput&#257;na desert,
which is also found in M&#257;rw&#257;r. <a id="d0e6970"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6970">253</a>]</span>Malcolm states<a id="d0e6972src" href="#d0e6972" class="noteref">5</a> that when the R&#257;jp&#363;ts migrated from the banks of the Ganges to R&#257;jput&#257;na, their Br&#257;hman priests did not accompany them in
any numbers, and hence the Ch&#257;rans arose and supplied their place. They had to understand the rites of worship, particularly
of Siva and P&#257;rvati, the favourite deities of the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and were taught to read and write. One class became merchants and
travelled with large convoys of goods, and the others were the bards and genealogists of the R&#257;jp&#363;ts. Their songs were in
the rudest metre, and their language was the local dialect, understood by all. All this evidence shows that the Ch&#257;rans were
a class of R&#257;jp&#363;t bards.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6975">
<h3>3. Lower-class Bh&#257;ts.</h3>
<p>But besides the Birm or Br&#257;hman Bh&#257;ts and the R&#257;jp&#363;t Ch&#257;rans there is another large body of the caste of mixed origin, who
serve as bards of the lower castes and are probably composed to a great extent of members of these castes. These are known
as the Brid-dhari or begging Bh&#257;ts. They beg from such castes as Lodhis, Telis, Kurmis, Ah&#299;rs and so on, each caste having
a separate section of Bh&#257;ts to serve it; the Bh&#257;ts of each caste take food from the members of the caste, but they also eat
and intermarry with each other. Again, there are Bair&#257;gi Bh&#257;ts who beg from Bair&#257;gis, and keep the genealogies of the temple-priests
and their successors. Yet another class are the Dasaundhis or Jasondhis, who sing songs in honour of Devi, play on musical
instruments and practise astrology. These rank below the cultivating castes and sometimes admit members of such castes who
have taken religious vows.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e6980">
<h3>4. Social status of the caste.</h3>
<p>The Br&#257;hman or Birm-Bh&#257;ts form a separate subcaste, and the R&#257;jp&#363;ts are sometimes called R&#257;jbh&#257;t. These wear the sacred thread,
which the Brid-Bh&#257;ts and Jasondhis do not. The social status of the Bh&#257;ts appears to vary greatly. Sir H. Risley states that
they rank immediately below K&#257;yasths, and Br&#257;hmans will take water from their hands. The Ch&#257;rans are treated by the R&#257;jp&#363;ts
with the greatest respect;<a id="d0e6985src" href="#d0e6985" class="noteref">6</a> the highest ruler rises when one of this class enters or leaves an assembly, and the Ch&#257;ran is invited to eat first at a
R&#257;jp&#363;t feast. He smokes from the same huqqa as R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and only caste-fellows can do this, as the smoke <a id="d0e6990"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6990">254</a>]</span>passes through water on its way to the mouth. In past times the Ch&#257;ran acted as a herald, and his person was inviolable. He
was addressed as Mah&#257;r&#257;j,<a id="d0e6992src" href="#d0e6992" class="noteref">7</a> and could sit on the Singh&#257;san or Lion&#8217;s Hide, the ancient term for a R&#257;jp&#363;t throne, as well as on the hides of the tiger,
panther and black antelope. The R&#257;jp&#363;ts held him in equal estimation with the Br&#257;hman or perhaps even greater.<a id="d0e6995src" href="#d0e6995" class="noteref">8</a> This was because they looked to him to enshrine their heroic deeds in his songs and hand them down to posterity. His sarcastic
references to a defeat in battle or any act displaying a want of courage inflamed their passions as nothing else could do.
On the other hand, the Brid-Bh&#257;ts, who serve the lower castes, occupy an inferior position. This is because they beg at weddings
and other feasts, and accept cooked food from members of the caste who are their clients. Such an act constitutes an admission
of inferior status, and as the Bh&#257;ts eat together their position becomes equivalent to that of the lowest group among them.
Thus if other Bh&#257;ts eat with the Bh&#257;ts of Telis or Kal&#257;rs, who have taken cooked food from their clients, they are all in
the position of having taken food from Telis and Kal&#257;rs, a thing which only the lowest castes will do. If the Bh&#257;t of any
caste, such as the Kurmis, keeps a girl of that caste, she can be admitted into the community, which is therefore of a very
mixed character. Such a caste as the Kurmis will not even take water from the hands of the Bh&#257;ts who serve them. This rule
applies also where a special section of the caste itself act as bards and minstrels. Thus the Pardh&#257;ns are the bards of the
Gonds, but rank below ordinary Gonds, who give them food and will not take it from them. And the S&#257;nsias, the bards of the
J&#257;ts, and the Mir&#257;sis, who are employed in this capacity by the lower castes generally, occupy a very inferior position, and
are sometimes considered as impure.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7000">
<h3>5. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The customs of the Bh&#257;ts resemble those of other castes of corresponding status. The higher Bh&#257;ts forbid the remarriage of
widows, and expel a girl who becomes pregnant before marriage. They carry a dagger, the special emblem of the Ch&#257;rans, in
order to be distinguished from low-class <a id="d0e7005"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7005">255</a>]</span>Bh&#257;ts. The Bh&#257;ts generally display the <i>chaur</i> or yak-tail whisk and the <i>chhadi</i> or silver-plated rod on ceremonial occasions, and they worship these emblems of their calling on the principal festivals.
The former is waved over the bridegroom at a wedding, and the latter is borne before him. The Br&#257;hman Bh&#257;ts abstain from flesh
of any kind and liquor, and other Bh&#257;ts usually have the same rules about food as the caste whom they serve. Br&#257;hman Bh&#257;ts
and Ch&#257;rans alone wear the sacred thread. The high status sometimes assigned to this division of the caste is shown in the
saying:


</p>
<div class="poem" lang="und">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>Age Br&#257;hman p&#299;chhe Bh&#257;t
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>t&#257;ke p&#299;chhe aur j&#257;t,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or, &#8216;First comes the Br&#257;hman, then the Bh&#257;t, and after them the other castes.&#8217;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7020">
<h3>6. The Bh&#257;t&#8217;s business.</h3>
<p>The business of a Bh&#257;t in former times is thus described by Forbes:<a id="d0e7025src" href="#d0e7025" class="noteref">9</a> &#8220;When the rainy season closes and travelling becomes practicable, the bard sets off on his yearly tour from his residence
in the Bh&#257;tw&#257;ra or bard&#8217;s quarter of some city or town. One by one he visits each of the R&#257;jp&#363;t chiefs who are his patrons,
and from whom he has received portions of land or annual grants of money, timing his arrival, if possible, to suit occasions
of marriage or other domestic festivals. After he has received the usual courtesies he produces the Wai, a book written in
his own crabbed hieroglyphics or in those of his father, which contains the descent of the house from its founder, interspersed
with many a verse or ballad, the dark sayings contained in which are chanted forth in musical cadence to a delighted audience,
and are then orally interpreted by the bard with many an illustrative anecdote or tale. The Wai, however, is not merely a
source for the gratification of family pride or even of love of song; it is also a record by which questions of relationship
are determined when a marriage is in prospect, and disputes relating to the division of ancestral property are decided, intricate
as these last necessarily are from the practice of polygamy and the rule that all the sons of a family are entitled to a share.
It is the duty of the bard at each periodical visit to register the births, marriages and deaths <a id="d0e7030"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7030">256</a>]</span>which have taken place in the family since his last circuit, as well as to chronicle all the other events worthy of remark
which have occurred to affect the fortunes of his patron; nor have we ever heard even a doubt suggested regarding the accurate,
much less the honest fulfilment of this duty by the bard. The manners of the bardic tribe are very similar to those of their
R&#257;jp&#363;t clients; their dress is nearly the same, but the bard seldom appears without the <i>kat&#257;r</i> or dagger, a representation of which is scrawled beside his signature, and often rudely engraved upon his monumental stone,
in evidence of his death in the sacred duty of <i>tr&#257;ga</i> (suicide).&#8221;<a id="d0e7038src" href="#d0e7038" class="noteref">10</a>

<h3>7. Their extortionate practices.</h3>
<p>The Bh&#257;t thus fulfilled a most useful function as registrar of births and marriages. But his merits were soon eclipsed by
the evils produced by his custom of extolling liberal patrons and satirising those who gave inadequately. The desire of the
R&#257;jp&#363;ts to be handed down to fame in the Bh&#257;t&#8217;s songs was such that no extravagance was spared to satisfy him. Chand, the
great R&#257;jp&#363;t bard, sang of the marriage of Prithwi R&#257;j, king of Delhi, that the bride&#8217;s father emptied his coffers in gifts,
but he filled them with the praises of mankind. A lakh of rupees<a id="d0e7053src" href="#d0e7053" class="noteref">11</a> was given to the chief bard, and this became a precedent for similar occasions. &#8220;Until vanity suffers itself to be controlled,&#8221;
Colonel Tod wrote,<a id="d0e7077src" href="#d0e7077" class="noteref">12</a> &#8220;and the aristocratic R&#257;jp&#363;ts submit to republican simplicity, the evils arising from nuptial profusion will not cease. Unfortunately
those who should check it find their interest in stimulating it, namely, the whole crowd of <i>m&#257;ngtas</i> or beggars, bards, minstrels, jugglers, Br&#257;hmans, who assemble on these occasions, and pour forth their epithalamiums in
praise of the virtue of liberality. The bards are the grand recorders of fame, and the volume of precedent is always <a id="d0e7085"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7085">257</a>]</span>resorted to by citing the liberality of former chiefs; while the dread of their satire<a id="d0e7087src" href="#d0e7087" class="noteref">13</a> shuts the eyes of the chief to consequences, and they are only anxious to maintain the reputation of their ancestors, though
fraught with future ruin.&#8221; Owing to this insensate liberality in the desire to satisfy the bards and win their praises, a
R&#257;jp&#363;t chief who had to marry a daughter was often practically ruined; and the desire to avoid such obligations led to the
general practice of female infanticide, formerly so prevalent in R&#257;jput&#257;na. The importance of the bards increased their voracity;
Mr. Nesfield describes them as &#8220;Rapacious and conceited mendicants, too proud to work but not too proud to beg.&#8221; The Dholis<a id="d0e7092src" href="#d0e7092" class="noteref">14</a> or minstrels were one of the seven great evils which the famous king Sidhr&#257;j expelled from Anhilw&#257;da P&#257;tan in Gujar&#257;t; the
D&#257;kans or witches were another.<a id="d0e7098src" href="#d0e7098" class="noteref">15</a> Malcolm states that &#8220;They give praise and fame in their songs to those who are liberal to them, while they visit those who
neglect or injure them with satires in which the victims are usually reproached with illegitimate birth and meanness of character.
Sometimes the Bh&#257;t, if very seriously offended, fixes an effigy of the person he desires to degrade on a long pole and appends
to it a slipper as a mark of disgrace. In such cases the song of the Bh&#257;t records the infamy of the object of his revenge.
This image usually travels the country till the party or his friends purchase the cessation of the curses and ridicule thus
entailed. It is not deemed in these countries within the power of the prince, much less any other person, to stop a Bh&#257;t or
even punish him for such a proceeding. In 1812 Sevak R&#257;m Seth, a banker of Holkar&#8217;s court, offended one of these Bh&#257;ts, pushing
him rudely out of the shop where the man had come to ask alms. The man made a figure<a id="d0e7103src" href="#d0e7103" class="noteref">16</a> of him to which he attached a slipper and carried it to court, and everywhere sang the infamy of the Seth. The latter, though
a man of wealth and influence, could not prevent him, but obstinately refused to purchase his forbearance. His friends after
some months subscribed Rs. 80 and the Bh&#257;t discontinued his execrations, but said it was <a id="d0e7109"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7109">258</a>]</span>too late, as his curses had taken effect; and the superstitious Hindus ascribe the ruin of the banker, which took place some
years afterwards, to this unfortunate event.&#8221; The loquacity and importunity of the Bh&#257;ts are shown in the saying, &#8216;Four Bh&#257;ts
make a crowd&#8217;; and their insincerity in the proverb quoted by Mr. Crooke, &#8220;The bard, the innkeeper and the harlot have no
heart; they are polite when customers arrive, but neglect those leaving (after they have paid)&#8221;<a id="d0e7111src" href="#d0e7111" class="noteref">17</a> The Bh&#257;t women are as bold, voluble and ready in retort as the men. When a Bh&#257;t woman passes a male caste-fellow on the road,
it is the latter who raises a piece of cloth to his face till the woman is out of sight.<a id="d0e7116src" href="#d0e7116" class="noteref">18</a>

<h3>8. The Jasondhis.</h3>
<p>Some of the lower classes of Bh&#257;ts have become religious mendicants and musicians, and perform ceremonial functions. Thus
the Jasondhis, who are considered a class of Bh&#257;ts, take their name from the <i>jas</i> or hymns sung in praise of Devi. They are divided into various sections, as the Nak&#299;b or flag-bearers in a procession, the
N&#257;zir or ushers who introduced visitors to the R&#257;ja, the Nag&#257;ria or players on kettle-drums, the Karaola who pour sesamum
oil on their clothes and beg, and the Panda, who serve as priests of Devi, and beg carrying an image of the goddess in their
hands. There is also a section of Muhammadan Bh&#257;ts who serve as bards and genealogists for Muhammadan castes. Some Bh&#257;ts,
having the rare and needful qualification of literacy so that they can read the old Sanskrit medical works, have, like a number
of Br&#257;hmans, taken to the practice of medicine and are known as Kavir&#257;j.

<h3>9. The Ch&#257;rans as carriers.</h3>
<p>As already stated, the persons of the Ch&#257;rans in the capacity of bard and herald were sacred, and they travelled from court
to court without fear of molestation from robbers or enemies. It seems likely that the Ch&#257;rans may have united the breeding
of cattle to their calling of bard; but in any case the advantage derived from their sanctity was so important that they gradually
became the chief carriers and traders of R&#257;jput&#257;na and the adjoining tracts. They further, in virtue of their holy character,
enjoyed a partial exemption from the perpetual and harassing imposts levied <a id="d0e7134"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7134">259</a>]</span>by every petty State on produce entering its territory; and the combination of advantages thus obtained was such as to give
them almost a monopoly in trade. They carried merchandise on large droves of bullocks all over R&#257;jput&#257;na and the adjoining
countries; and in course of time the carriers restricted themselves to their new profession, splitting off from the Ch&#257;rans
and forming the caste of Banj&#257;ras.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7136">
<h3>10. Suicide and the fear of ghosts.</h3>
<p>But the mere reverence for their calling would not have sufficed for a permanent safeguard to the Ch&#257;rans from destitute and
unscrupulous robbers. They preserved it by the customs of <i>Chandi</i> or <i>Tr&#257;ga</i> and <i>Dharna</i>. These consisted in their readiness to mutilate, starve or kill themselves rather than give up property entrusted to their
care; and it was a general belief that their ghosts would then haunt the persons whose ill deeds had forced them to take their
own lives. It seems likely that this belief in the power of a suicide or murdered man to avenge himself by haunting any persons
who had injured him or been responsible for his death may have had a somewhat wide prevalence and been partly accountable
for the reprobation attaching in early times to the murderer and the act of self-slaughter. The haunted murderer would be
impure and would bring ill-fortune on all who had to do with him, while the injury which a suicide would inflict on his relatives
in haunting them would cause this act to be regarded as a sin against one&#8217;s family and tribe. Even the ordinary fear of the
ghosts of people who die in the natural course, and especially of those who are killed by accident, is so strong that a large
part of the funeral rites is devoted to placating and laying the ghost of the dead man; and in India the period of observance
of mourning for the dead is perhaps in reality that time during which the spirit of the dead man is supposed to haunt his
old abode and render the survivors of his family impure. It was this fear of ghosts on which the Ch&#257;rans relied, nor did they
hesitate a moment to sacrifice their lives in defence of any obligation they had undertaken or of property committed to their
care. When plunderers carried off any cattle belonging to the Ch&#257;rans, the whole community would proceed to the spot where
the robbers resided; and in failure of having their property <a id="d0e7150"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7150">260</a>]</span>restored would cut off the heads of several of their old men and women. Frequent instances occurred of a man dressing himself
in cotton-quilted cloths steeped in oil which he set on fire at the bottom, and thus danced against the person against whom
<i>tr&#257;ga</i> was performed until the miserable creature dropped down and was burnt to ashes. On one occasion a Cutch chieftain, attempting
to escape with his wife and child from a village, was overtaken by his enemy when about to leap a precipice; immediately turning
he cut off his wife&#8217;s head with his scimitar and, flourishing his reeking blade in the face of his pursuer, denounced against
him the curse of the <i>tr&#257;ga</i> which he had so fearfully performed.<a id="d0e7158src" href="#d0e7158" class="noteref">19</a> In this case it was supposed that the wife&#8217;s ghost would haunt the enemy who had driven the husband to kill her.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7164">
<h3>11. Instances of haunting and laying ghosts.</h3>
<p>The following account in the <i>R&#257;sm&#257;la</i><a id="d0e7171src" href="#d0e7171" class="noteref">20</a> is an instance of suicide and of the actual haunting by the ghost: A Ch&#257;ran asserted a claim against the chief of Siela in
K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r, which the latter refused to liquidate. The bard thereupon, taking forty of his caste with him, went to Siela with
the intention of sitting <i>Dharna</i> at the chief&#8217;s door and preventing any one from coming out or going in until the claim should be discharged. However, as
they approached the town, the chief, becoming aware of their intention, caused the gates to be closed. The bards remained
outside and for three days abstained from food; on the fourth day they proceeded to perform <i>tr&#257;ga</i> as follows: some hacked their own arms; others decapitated three old women of the party and hung their heads up at the gate
as a garland; certain of the women cut off their own breasts. The bards also pierced the throats of four of their old men
with spikes, and they took two young girls by the heels, and dashed out their brains against the town gate. The Ch&#257;ran to
whom the money was due dressed himself in clothes wadded with cotton which he steeped in oil and then set on fire. He thus
burned himself to death. But as he died he cried out, &#8220;I am now dying; but I will become a headless ghost (<i>Kuv&#299;s</i>) in the palace, and will take the chiefs life and cut off his posterity.&#8221; After this sacrifice the rest of the bards returned
home.
<a id="d0e7183"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7183">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the third day after the Ch&#257;ran&#8217;s death his Bh&#363;t (ghost) threw the R&#257;ni downstairs so that she was very much injured. Many
other persons also beheld the headless phantom in the palace. At last he entered the chief&#8217;s head and set him trembling. At
night he would throw stones at the palace, and he killed a female servant outright. At length, in consequence of the various
acts of oppression which he committed, none dared to approach the chief&#8217;s mansion even in broad daylight. In order to exorcise
the Bh&#363;t, Jogis, Fak&#299;rs and Br&#257;hmans were sent for from many different places; but whoever attempted the cure was immediately
assailed by the Bh&#363;t in the chief&#8217;s body, and that so furiously that the exorcist&#8217;s courage failed him. The Bh&#363;t would also
cause the chief to tear the flesh off his own arms with his teeth. Besides this, four or five persons died of injuries received
from the Bh&#363;t; but nobody had the power to expel him. At length a foreign Jyotishi (astrologer) came who had a great reputation
for charms and magic, and the chief sent for him and paid him honour. First he tied all round the house threads which he had
charged with a charm; then he sprinkled charmed milk and water all round; then he drove a charmed iron nail into the ground
at each corner of the mansion, and two at the door. He purified the house and continued his charms and incantations for forty-one
days, every day making sacrifices at the cemetery to the Bh&#363;t&#8217;s spirit. The Joshi lived in a room securely fastened up; but
people say that while he was muttering his charms stones would fall and strike the windows. Finally the Joshi brought the
chief, who had been living in a separate room, and tried to exorcise the spirit. The patient began to be very violent, but
the Joshi and his people spared no pains in thrashing him until they had rendered him quite docile. A sacrificial fire-pit
was made and a lemon placed between it and the chief. The Joshi commanded the Bh&#363;t to enter the lime. The possessed, however,
said, &#8216;Who are you; if one of your Deos (gods) were to come, I would not quit this person.&#8217; Thus they went on from morning
till noon. At last they came outside, and, burning various kinds of incense and sprinkling many charms, the Bh&#363;t was got out
into the lemon. When the lemon began <a id="d0e7186"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7186">262</a>]</span>to jump about, the whole of the spectators praised the Joshi, crying out: &#8216;The Bh&#363;t has gone into the lemon! The Bh&#363;t has
gone into the lemon!&#8217; The possessed person himself, when he saw the lemon hopping about, was perfectly satisfied that the
Bh&#363;t had left his body and gone out into the lemon. The Joshi then drove the lemon outside the city, followed by drummers
and trumpeters; if the lemon left the road, he would touch it with his stick and put it into the right way again. On the track
they sprinkled mustard and salt and finally buried the lemon in a pit seven cubits deep, throwing into the hole above it mustard
and salt, and over these dust and stones, and filling in the space between the stones with lead. At each corner, too, the
Joshi drove in an iron nail, two feet long, which he had previously charmed. The lemon buried, the people returned home, and
not one of them ever saw the Bh&#363;t thereafter. According to the recorder of the tale, the cure was effected by putting quicksilver
into the lemon. When a man is attacked with fever or becomes speechless or appears to have lockjaw, his friends conclude from
these indications that he is possessed by a Bh&#363;t.

</p>
<p>In another case some Bh&#257;ts had been put in charge, by the chief of a small State, of a village which was coveted by a neighbouring
prince, the R&#257;na of D&#257;nta. The latter sent for the Bh&#257;ts and asked them to guard one or two of his villages, and having obtained
their absence by this pretext he raided their village, carrying off hostages and cattle. When the Bh&#257;ts got back they collected
to the number of a hundred and began to perform <i>Dharna</i> against the R&#257;na. They set out from their village, and at every two miles as they advanced they burned a man, so that by
the time they got to the Rana&#8217;s territory seven or eight men had been burnt. They were then pacified by his people and induced
to go back. The R&#257;na offered them presents, but they refused to accept them, as they said the guilt of the death of their
fellows who had been burned would thereby be removed from the R&#257;na. The R&#257;na lost all the seven sons born to him and died
childless, and it was generally held to be on account of this sin.<a id="d0e7193src" href="#d0e7193" class="noteref">21</a>

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7200">
<h3>12. The Ch&#257;rans as sureties.</h3>
<p>Such was the certainty attaching to the Ch&#257;ran&#8217;s readiness to forfeit his life rather than prove false to a trust, and the
fear entertained of the offence of causing him to do so and being haunted by his ghost, that his security was eagerly coveted
in every kind of transaction. &#8220;No traveller could journey unattended by these guards, who for a small sum were satisfied to
conduct him in safety.<a id="d0e7205src" href="#d0e7205" class="noteref">22</a> The guards, called Val&#257;vas, were never backward in inflicting the most grievous wounds and even causing the death of their
old men and women if the robbers persisted in plundering those under their protection; but this seldom happened, as the wildest
Koli, K&#257;thi or R&#257;jp&#363;t held the person of a Ch&#257;ran sacred. Besides becoming safeguards to travellers and goods, they used to
stand security to the amount of many lakhs of rupees. When rents and property were concerned, the R&#257;jp&#363;ts preferred a Ch&#257;ran&#8217;s
bond to that of the wealthiest banker. They also gave security for good behaviour, called <i>ch&#257;lu z&#257;min</i>, and for personal attendance in court called <i>h&#257;zar z&#257;min</i>. The ordinary <i>tr&#257;ga</i> went no farther than a cut on the arm with the <i>kat&#257;r</i> or crease; the forearms of those who were in the habit of becoming security had generally several cuts from the elbow downwards.
The Ch&#257;rans, both men and women, wounded themselves, committed suicide and murdered their relations with the most complete
self-devotion. In 1812 the Mar&#257;thas brought a body of troops to impose a payment on the village of P&#257;nchpipla.<a id="d0e7225src" href="#d0e7225" class="noteref">23</a> The Ch&#257;rans resisted the demand, but finding the Mar&#257;thas determined to carry their point, after a remonstrance against paying
any kind of revenue as being contrary to their occupation and principles, they at last cut the throats of ten young children
and threw them at the feet of the Mar&#257;thas, exclaiming, &#8216;These are our riches and the only payment we can make.&#8217; The Ch&#257;rans
were immediately seized and confined in irons at Jambusar.&#8221;

</p>
<p>As was the case with the Bh&#257;t and the Br&#257;hman, the source of the Ch&#257;ran&#8217;s power lay in the widespread fear that a Ch&#257;ran&#8217;s
blood brought ruin on him who caused the blood to be spilt. It was also sometimes considered that the <a id="d0e7230"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7230">264</a>]</span>Ch&#257;ran was possessed by his deity, and the caste were known as Deoputra or sons of God, the favourite dwelling of the guardian
spirit.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7232">
<h3>13. Suicide as a means of revenge.</h3>
<p>Such a belief enhanced the guilt attaching to the act of causing or being responsible for a Ch&#257;ran&#8217;s death. Suicide from motives
of revenge has been practised in other countries. &#8220;Another common form of suicide which is admired as heroic in China is that
committed for the purpose of taking revenge upon an enemy who is otherwise out of reach&#8212;according to Chinese ideas a most
effective mode of revenge, not only because the law throws the responsibility of the deed on him who occasioned it, but also
because the disembodied soul is supposed to be better able than the living man to persecute the enemy.&#8221;<a id="d0e7237src" href="#d0e7237" class="noteref">24</a> Similarly, among the Hos or Mundas the suicide of young married women is or was extremely common, and the usual motive was
that the girl, being unhappy in her husband&#8217;s house, jumped down a well or otherwise made away with herself in the belief
that she would take revenge on his family by haunting them after her death. The treatment of the suicide&#8217;s body was sometimes
directed to prevent his spirit from causing trouble. &#8220;According to Jewish custom persons who had killed themselves were left
unburied till sunset, perhaps for fear lest the spirit of the deceased otherwise might find its way back to the old home.&#8221;<a id="d0e7243src" href="#d0e7243" class="noteref">25</a> At Athens the right hand of a person who had taken his own life was struck off and buried apart from the rest of the body,
evidently in order to make him harmless after death.<a id="d0e7249src" href="#d0e7249" class="noteref">26</a> Similarly, in England suicides were buried with a spike through the chest to prevent their spirits from rising, and at cross-roads,
so that the ghost might not be able to find its way home. This fear appears to have partly underlain the idea that suicide
was a crime or an offence against society and the state, though, as shown by Dr. Westermarck, the reprobation attaching to
it was far from universal; while in the cultured communities of ancient Greece and Rome, and among such military peoples as
the Japanese suicide was considered at all times a legitimate and, on occasion, a highly meritorious and praiseworthy act.
<a id="d0e7255"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7255">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>That condition of mind which leads to the taking of one&#8217;s own life from motives of revenge is perhaps a fruit of ignorance
and solitude. The mind becomes distorted, and the sufferer attributes the unhappiness really caused by accident or his own
faults or defects to the persecution of a malignant fate or the ill-will of his neighbours and associates. And long brooding
over his wrongs eventuates in his taking the extreme step. The crime known as running amok appears to be the outcome of a
similar state of mind. Here too the criminal considers his wrongs or misery as the result of injury or unjust treatment from
his fellow-men, and, careless of his own life, determines to be revenged on them. Such hatred of one&#8217;s kind is cured by education,
leading to a truer appreciation of the circumstances and environment which determine the course of life, and by the more cheerful
temper engendered by social intercourse. And these crimes of vengeance tend to die out with the advance of civilisation.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7258">
<h3>14. <i>Dharna.</i></h3>
<p>Analogous to the custom of <i>tr&#257;ga</i> was that of <i>Dharna</i>, which was frequently and generally resorted to for the redress of wrongs and offences at a time when the law made little
provision for either. The ordinary method of <i>Dharna</i> was to sit starving oneself in front of the door of the person from whom redress was sought until he gave it from fear of
causing the death of the suppliant and being haunted by his ghost. It was, naturally, useless unless the person seeking redress
was prepared to go to extremes, and has some analogy to the modern hunger-strike with the object of getting out of jail. Another
common device was to thrust a spear-blade through both cheeks, and in this state to dance before the person against whom <i>Dharna</i> was practised. The pain had to be borne without a sign of suffering, which, if displayed, would destroy its efficacy. Or
a creditor would proceed to the door of his debtor and demand payment, and if not appeased would stand up in his presence
with an enormous weight upon his head, which he had brought with him for the purpose, swearing never to alter his position
until satisfaction was given, and denouncing at the same time the most horrible execrations on his debtor, should he suffer
him to expire in that situation. This seldom failed to produce the desired effect, but should he actually die <a id="d0e7277"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7277">266</a>]</span>while in <i>Dharna</i>, the debtor&#8217;s house was razed to the earth and he and his family sold for the satisfaction of the creditor&#8217;s heirs. Another
and more desperate form of <i>Dharna</i>, only occasionally resorted to, was to erect a large pile of wood before the house of the debtor, and after the customary
application for payment had been refused the creditor tied on the top of the pile a cow or a calf, or very frequently an old
woman, generally his mother or other relation, swearing at the same time to set fire to it if satisfaction was not instantly
given. All the time the old woman denounced the bitterest curses, threatening to persecute the wretched debtor both here and
hereafter.<a id="d0e7285src" href="#d0e7285" class="noteref">27</a>

</p>
<p>The word <i>dharna</i> means &#8216;to place or lay on,&#8217; and hence &#8216;a pledge.&#8217; Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l suggests that the standing with a weight on the head may have
been the original form of the penance, from which the other and severer methods were subsequently derived. Another custom
known as <i>dharna</i> is that of a suppliant placing a stone on the shrine of a god or tomb of a saint. He makes his request and, laying the stone
on the shrine, says, &#8220;Here I place this stone until you fulfil my prayer; if I do not remove it, the shame is on you.&#8221; If
the prayer is afterwards fulfilled, he takes away the stone and offers a cocoanut. It seems clear that the underlying idea
of this custom is the same as that of standing with a stone on the head as described above, but it is difficult to say which
was the earlier or original form.

<h3>15. Casting out spirits.</h3>
<p>As a general rule, if the guilt of having caused a suicide was at a man&#8217;s door, he should expiate it by going to the Ganges
to bathe. When a man was haunted by the ghost of any one whom he had wronged, whether such a person had committed suicide
or simply died of grief at being unable to obtain redress, it was said of him <i>Brahm laga</i>, or that Brahma had possessed him. The spirit of a Br&#257;hman boy, who has died unmarried, is also accustomed to haunt any person
who walks over his grave in an impure condition or otherwise defiles it, and when a man is haunted in such a manner it is
called <i>Brahm laga</i>. Then an exorcist is called, <a id="d0e7313"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7313">267</a>]</span>who sprinkles water over the possessed man, and this burns the Brahm Deo or spirit inside him as if it were burning oil. The
spirit cries out, and the exorcist orders him to leave the man. Then the spirit states how he has been injured by the man,
and refuses to leave him. The exorcist asks him what he requires on condition of leaving the man, and he asks for some good
food or something else, and is given it. The exorcist takes a nail and goes to a <i>p&#299;pal</i> tree and orders the Brahm Deo to go into the tree. Brahm Deo obeys, and the exorcist drives the nail into the tree and the
spirit remains imprisoned there until somebody takes the nail out, when he will come out again and haunt him. The Hindus think
that the god Brahma lives in the roots of the <i>p&#299;pal</i> tree, Siva in its branches, and Vishnu in the <i>choti</i> or scalp-knot, that is the topmost foliage.

<h3>16. Sulking. Going bankrupt.</h3>
<p>Another and mild form of <i>Dharna</i> is that known as <i>Kh&#257;tp&#257;ti</i>. When a woman is angry with her husband on account of his having refused her some request, she will put her bed in a corner
of the room and go and lie on it, turning her face to the wall, and remain so, not answering when spoken to nor taking food.
The term Kh&#257;tp&#257;ti signifies keeping to one side of the bed, and there she will remain until her husband accedes to her request,
unless indeed he should decide to beat her instead. This is merely an exaggerated form of the familiar display of temper known
as sulking. It is interesting to note the use of the phrase turning one&#8217;s face to the wall, with something of the meaning
attached to it in the Bible.

</p>
<p>A custom similar to that of <i>Dharna</i> was called <i>Diw&#257;la nik&#257;lna</i> or going bankrupt. When a merchant had had heavy losses and could not meet his liabilities, he would place the lock of his
door outside, reversing it, and sit in the veranda with a piece of sackcloth over him. Or he wrapped round him the floor-carpet
of his room. When he had displayed these signs of ruin and self-abasement his creditors would not sue him, but he would never
be able to borrow money again.

<h3>17. Bh&#257;t songs.</h3>
<p>In conclusion a few specimens of Bh&#257;t songs may be given. The following is an account of the last king of N&#257;gpur, Raghuji
III., commonly known as B&#257;ji Rao:

<a id="d0e7348"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7348">268</a>]</span></p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>They made a picture of B&#257;ji Rao;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>B&#257;ji Rao was the finest king to see;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The Br&#257;hmans told lies about him,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>They sent a letter from N&#257;gpur to Calcutta,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>They made B&#257;ji Rao go on a pilgrimage.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Brothers! the great Sird&#257;rs who were with him,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>They brought a troop of five hundred horse!
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The Tuesday fair in Ben&#257;res was held with fireworks,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>They made the Ganges pink with rose-petals.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>B&#257;ji Rao&#8217;s gifts were splendid,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>His turban and coat were of brocaded silk,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>A pair of diamonds and emeralds
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>He gave to the Br&#257;hmans of Ben&#257;res.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Oh brothers! the R&#257;ja sat in a covered howdah bound on an elephant!
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Many fans waved over his head;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>How charitable a king he was!</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the above song a note of regret is manifest for the parade and display of the old court of N&#257;gpur, English rule being less
picturesque. The next is a song about the English:

</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>The English have taken the throne of N&#257;gpur,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The fear of the English is great.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>In a moment&#8217;s time they conquer countries.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The guns boomed, the English came strong and warlike,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>They give wealth to all.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>They ram the ramrods in the guns.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>They conquered also Tippoo&#8217;s dominions,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The English are ruling in the fort of G&#257;wilgarh.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The following is another song about the English, not quite so complimentary:

</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>The English became our kings and have made current the <i>kald&#257;r</i> (milled) rupee.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The menials are favoured and the Bh&#257;ts have lost their profession,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The mango has lost its taste, the milk has lost its sweetness,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The rose has lost its scent.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>B&#257;ji Rao of N&#257;gpur he also is gone,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>No longer are the drums beaten at the palace gate.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Poona customs have come in.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Br&#257;hmans knowing the eighteen Pur&#257;ns have become Christians;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The son thinks himself better than his father,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The daughter-in-law no longer respects her mother-in-law.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The wife fights with her husband.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The English have made the railways and telegraphs;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The people wondered at the silver rupees and all the country prospered.</span></p>
</div>
</div><a id="d0e7433"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7433">269</a>]</span><p>The following is a song about the Nerbudda at Mandla, Rewa being another name for the river:


</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>The stream of the world springs out breaking apart the hills;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The Rewa cuts her path through the soil, the air is darkened with her spray.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>All the length of her banks are the seats of saints; hermits and pilgrims worship her.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>On seeing the holy river a man&#8217;s sins fall away as wood is cut by a saw;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>By bathing in her he plucks the fruit of holiness.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>When boats are caught in her flood, the people pray: &#8216;We are sinners, O Rewa, bring us safely to the bank!&#8217;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>When the Nerbudda is in flood, Mandla is an island and the people think their end has come:
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The rain pours down on all sides, earth and sky become dark as smoke, and men call on R&#257;ma.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The bard says: &#8216;Let it rain as it may, some one will save us as Krishna saved the people of Brind&#257;wan!&#8217;</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a description of a beautiful woman:

</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>A beautiful woman is loved by her neighbours,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>But she will let none come to her and answers them not.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>They say: &#8216;Since God has made you so beautiful, open your litter and let yourself be seen!&#8217;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>He who sees her is struck as by lightning, she shoots her lover with the darts of her eyes, invisible herself.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>She will not go to her husband&#8217;s house till he has her brought by the Government.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>When she goes her father&#8217;s village is left empty.
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>She is so delicate she faints at the sight of a flower,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Her body cannot bear the weight of her cloth,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The garland of jasmine-flowers is a burden on her neck,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The red powder on her feet is too heavy for them.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is interesting to note that weakness and delicacy in a woman are emphasised as an attraction, as in English literature
of the eighteenth century.

</p>
<p>The last is a gentle intimation that poets, like other people, have to live:

</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>It is useless to adorn oneself with sandalwood on an empty belly,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Nobody&#8217;s body gets fat from the scent of flowers;
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>The singing of songs excites the mind,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>But if the body is not fed all these are vain and hollow.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All Bh&#257;ts recite their verses in a high-pitched sing-song tone, which renders it very difficult for their hearers to grasp
<a id="d0e7493"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7493">270</a>]</span>the sense unless they know it already. The Vedas and all other sacred verses are spoken in this manner, perhaps as a mark
of respect and to distinguish them from ordinary speech. The method has some resemblance to intoning. Women use the same tone
when mourning for the dead.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7543">
<h3>1. General notice and structure of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Bhatra.</b><a id="d0e7549src" href="#d0e7549" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A primitive tribe of the Bastar State and the south of Raipur District, akin to the Gonds. They numbered 33,000 persons in
1891, and in subsequent enumerations have been amalgamated with the Gonds. Nothing is known of their origin except a legend
that they came with the R&#257;jas of Bastar from Warangal twenty-three generations ago. The word Bhatra is said to mean a servant,
and the tribe are employed as village watchmen and household and domestic servants. They have three divisions, the P&#299;t, Amn&#257;it
and S&#257;n Bhatras, who rank one below the other, the P&#299;t being the highest and the S&#257;n the lowest. The P&#299;t Bhatras base their
superiority on the fact that they decline to make grass mats, which the Amn&#257;it Bhatras will do, while the S&#257;n Bhatras are
considered to be practically identical with the Muria Gonds. Members of the three groups will eat with each other before marriage,
but afterwards they will take only food cooked without water from a person belonging to another group. They have the usual
set of exogamous septs named after plants and animals. Formerly, it is said, they were tattooed with representations <a id="d0e7552"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7552">272</a>]</span>of the totem plant and animal, and the septs named after the tiger and snake ate the flesh of these animals at a sacrificial
meal. These customs have fallen into abeyance, but still if they kill their totem animal they will make apologies to it, and
break their cooking-pots, and bury or burn the body. A man of substance will distribute alms in the name of the deceased animal.
In some localities members of the K&#257;chhun or tortoise sept will not eat a pumpkin which drops from a tree because it is considered
to resemble a tortoise. But if they can break it immediately on touching the ground they may partake of the fruit, the assumption
being apparently that it has not had time to become like a tortoise.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7554">
<h3>2. Admission of outsiders.</h3>
<p>Outsiders are not as a rule admitted. But a woman of equal or higher caste who enters the house of a Bhatra will be recognised
as his wife, and a man of the Pan&#257;ra, or gardener caste, can also become a member of the community if he lives with a Bhatra
woman and eats from her hand.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7559">
<h3>3. Arrangement of marriages.</h3>
<p>In Raipur a girl should be married before puberty, and if no husband is immediately available, they tie a few flowers into
her cloth and consider this as a marriage. If an unmarried girl becomes pregnant she is debarred from going through the wedding
ceremony, and will simply go and live with her lover or any other man. Matches are usually arranged by the parents, but if
a daughter is not pleased with the prospective bridegroom, who may sometimes be a well-to-do man much older than herself,
she occasionally runs away and goes through the ceremony on her own account with the man of her choice.

</p>
<p>If no one has asked her parents for her hand she may similarly select a husband for herself and make her wishes known, but
in that case she is temporarily put out of caste until the chosen bridegroom signifies his acquiescence by giving the marriage
feast. What happens if he definitely fails to respond is not stated, but presumably the young woman tries elsewhere until
she finds herself accepted.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7566">
<h3>4. The Counter of Posts.</h3>
<p>The date and hour of the wedding are fixed by an official known as the Meda Gantia, or Counter of Posts. He is a sort of illiterate
village astrologer, who can foretell the character of the rainfall, and gives auspicious dates for <a id="d0e7571"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7571">273</a>]</span>sowing and harvest. He goes through some training, and as a test of his capacity is required by his teacher to tell at a glance
the number of posts in an enclosure which he has not seen before. Having done this correctly he qualifies as a Meda Gantia.
Apparently the Bhatras, being unable at one time to count themselves, acquired an exaggerated reverence for the faculty of
counting, and thought that if a man could only count far enough he could reckon into the future; or it might be thought that
as he could count and name future days, he thus obtained power over them, and could tell what would happen on them just as
one can obtain power over a man and work him injury by knowing his real name.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7573">
<h3>5. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>At a wedding the couple walk seven times round the sacred post, which must be of wood of the mahua<a id="d0e7578src" href="#d0e7578" class="noteref">2</a> tree, and on its conclusion the post is taken to a river or stream and consigned to the water. The Bhatras, like the Gonds,
no doubt revere this tree because their intoxicating liquor is made from its flowers. The couple wear marriage crowns made
from the leaves of the date palm and exchange these. A little turmeric and flour are mixed with water in a plate, and the
bride, taking the bridegroom&#8217;s right hand, dips it into the coloured paste and strikes it against the wall. The action is
repeated five times, and then the bridegroom does the same with the bride&#8217;s hand. By this rite the couple pledge each other
for their mutual behaviour during married life. From the custom of making an impression of the hand on a wall in token of
a vow may have arisen that of clasping hands as a symbol of a bargain assented to, and hence of shaking hands, by persons
who meet, as a pledge of amity and the absence of hostile intentions. Usually the hand is covered with red ochre, which is
probably a substitute for blood; and the impression of the hand is made on the wall of a temple in token of a vow. This may
be a survival of the covenant made by the parties dipping their hands in the blood of the sacrifice and laying them on the
god. A pit about a foot deep is dug close to the marriage-shed, and filled with mud or wet earth. The bride conceals a nut
in the mud and the bridegroom has to find it, and <a id="d0e7583"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7583">274</a>]</span>the hiding and finding are repeated by both parties. This rite may have the signification of looking for children. The remainder
of the day is spent in eating, drinking and dancing. On the way home after the wedding the bridegroom has to shoot a deer,
the animal being represented by a branch of a tree thrown across the path by one of the party. But if a real deer happens
by any chance to come by he has to shoot this. The bride goes up to the real or sham deer and pulls out the arrow, and presents
her husband with water and a tooth-stick, after which he takes her in his arms and they dance home together. On arrival at
the house the bridegroom&#8217;s maternal uncle or his son lies down before the door covering himself with a blanket. He is asked
what he wants, and says he will have the daughter of the bridegroom to wife. The bridegroom promises to give a daughter if
he has one, and if he has a son to give him for a friend. The tribe consider that a man has a right to marry the daughter
of his maternal uncle, and formerly if the girl was refused by her parents he abducted her and married her forcibly. The bride
remains at her husband&#8217;s house for a few days and then goes home, and before she finally takes up her abode with him the <i>gauna</i> or going-away ceremony must be performed. The hands of the bride and bridegroom are tied together, and an arrow is held upright
on them and some oil poured over it. The foreheads of the couple are marked with turmeric and rice, this rite being known
as <i>t&#299;ka</i> or anointing, and presents are given to the bride&#8217;s family.

<h3>6. Propitiation of ghosts.</h3>
<p>The dead are buried, the corpse being laid on its back with the head to the north. Some rice, cowrie-shells, a winnowing-fan
and other articles are placed on the grave. The tribe probably consider the winnowing-fan to have some magical property, as
it also forms one of the presents given to the bride at the betrothal. If a man is killed by a tiger his spirit must be propitiated.
The priest ties strips of tiger-skin to his arms, and the feathers of the peacock and blue jay to his waist, and jumps about
pretending to be a tiger. A package of a hundred seers (200 lbs.) of rice is made up, and he sits on this and finally takes
it away with him. If the dead man had any ornaments they must all be given, however valuable, lest his spirit should hanker
after <a id="d0e7596"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7596">275</a>]</span>them and return to look for them in the shape of the tiger. The large quantity of rice given to the priest is also probably
intended as a provision of the best food for the dead man&#8217;s spirit, lest it be hungry and come in the shape of the tiger to
satisfy its appetite upon the surviving relatives. The laying of the ghosts of persons killed by tigers is thus a very profitable
business for the priests.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7598">
<h3>7. Religion. Ceremonies at hunting.</h3>
<p>The tribe worship the god of hunting, who is known as M&#257;ti Deo and resides in a separate tree in each village. At the B&#299;jph&#363;tni
(threshing) or harvest festival in the month of Chait (March) they have a ceremonial hunting party. All the people of the
village collect, each man having a bow and arrow slung to his back and a hatchet on his shoulder. They spread out a long net
in the forest and beat the animals into this, usually catching a deer, wild pig or hare, and quails and other birds. They
return and cook the game before the shrine of the god and offer to him a fowl and a pig. A pit is dug and water poured into
it, and a person from each house must stand in the mud. A little seed taken from each house is also soaked in the mud, and
after the feast is over this is taken and returned to the householder with words of abuse, a small present of two or three
pice being received from him. The seed is no doubt thus consecrated for the next sowing. The tribe also have joint ceremonial
fishing excursions. Their ideas of a future life are very vague, and they have no belief in a place of reward or punishment
after death. They propitiate the spirits of their ancestors on the 15th of As&#257;rh (June) with offerings of a little rice and
incense.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7603">
<h3>8. Superstitious remedies.</h3>
<p>To cure the evil eye they place a little gunpowder in water and apply it to the sufferer&#8217;s eyes, the idea perhaps being that
the fiery glance from the evil eye which struck him is quenched like the gunpowder. To bring on rain they perform a frog marriage,
tying two frogs to a pestle and pouring oil and turmeric over them as in a real marriage. The children carry them round begging
from door to door and finally deposit them in water. They say that when rain falls and the sun shines together the jackals
are being married. Formerly a woman suspected of being a witch was tied up in a bag and thrown into a river or tank <a id="d0e7608"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7608">276</a>]</span>at various places set apart for the purpose. If she sank she was held to be innocent, and if she floated, guilty. In the latter
case she had to defile herself by taking the bone of a cow and the tail of a pig in her mouth, and it was supposed that this
drove out the magic-working spirit. In the case of illness of their children or cattle, or the failure of crops, they consult
the Puj&#257;ri or priest and make an offering. He applies some flowers or grains of rice to the forehead of the deity, and when
one of these falls down he diagnoses from it the nature of the illness, and gives it to the sufferer to wear as a charm.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7610">
<h3>9. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The tribe are cultivators and farmservants, and practise shifting cultivation. They work as village watchmen and also as the
M&#257;jhi or village headman and the Puj&#257;ri or village priest. These officials are paid by contributions of grain from the cultivators.
And as already seen, the Bhatras are employed as household servants and will clean cooking-vessels. Since they act as village
priests, it may perhaps be concluded that the Bhatras like the Parjas are older residents of Bastar than the bulk of the Gonds,
and they have become the household servants of the Hindu immigrants, which the Gonds would probably disdain to do. Some of
them wear the sacred thread, but in former times the Bastar R&#257;ja would invest any man with this for a fee of four or five
rupees, and the Bhatras therefore purchased the social distinction. They find it inconvenient, however, and lay it aside when
proceeding to their work or going out to hunt. If a man breaks his thread he must wait till a Br&#257;hman comes round, when he
can purchase another.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7615">
<h3>10. Names.</h3>
<p>Among a list of personal names given by Mr. Baijn&#257;th the following are of some interest: Pillu, one of short stature; Matola,
one who learnt to walk late; Phagu, born in Ph&#257;gun (February); Ghinu, dirty-looking; Dasru, born on the Dasahra festival;
Ludki, one with a fleshy ear; Dalu, big-bellied; Mudi, a ring, this name having been given to a child which cried much after
birth, but when its nose was pierced and a ring put in it stopped crying; Chhi, given to a child which sneezed immediately
after birth; Nunha, a posthumous child; and Bhuklu, a child which began to play almost as soon as born. The above instances
<a id="d0e7620"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7620">277</a>]</span>indicate that it is a favourite plan to select the name from any characteristic displayed by the child soon after birth, or
from any circumstance or incident connected with its birth. Among names of women are: Cherangi, thin; Fundi, one with swollen
cheeks; Kandri, one given to crying; Mah&#299;na (month), a child born a month late; Batai, one with large eyes; Gaida, fat; Pakli,
of fair colour; Boda, one with crooked legs; Jhunki, one with small eyes; Rupi, a girl who was given a nose-ring of silver
as her brothers had died; Paro, born on a field-embankment; Dango, tall. A woman must not call by their names her father-in-law,
mother-in-law, her husband&#8217;s brothers and elder sisters and the sons and daughters of her husband&#8217;s brothers and sisters.

<h3>1. General notice. The Bh&#299;ls a Kolarian tribe.</h3>
<p><b>Bh&#299;l.</b><a id="d0e7692src" href="#d0e7692" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;An indigenous or non-Aryan tribe which has been much in contact with the Hindus and is consequently well known. The home
of the Bh&#299;ls is the country comprised in the hill ranges of Kh&#257;ndesh, Central India and R&#257;jput&#257;na, west from the Satp&#363;ras
to the sea in Gujar&#257;t. The total number of Bh&#299;ls in India exceeds a million and a half, of which the great bulk belong to
Bombay, R&#257;jput&#257;na and Central India. The Central Provinces have only about 28,000, practically all of whom reside in the Nim&#257;r
district, on the hills forming the western end of the Satp&#363;ra range and adjoining the R&#257;jpipla hills of Kh&#257;ndesh. As the southern
slopes of these hills lie in Ber&#257;r, a few Bh&#299;ls are also found there. The name Bh&#299;l seems to occur for the first time about
<span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 600. It is supposed to be derived from the Dravidian word for a bow, which is the characteristic weapon of the tribe. It
has been suggested that the Bh&#299;ls <a id="d0e7719"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7719">279</a>]</span>are the Pygmies referred to by Ktesias (400 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>) and the Phyllitae of Ptolemy (<span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 150). The Bh&#299;ls are recognised as the oldest inhabitants of southern R&#257;jput&#257;na and parts of Gujar&#257;t, and are usually spoken
of in conjunction with the Kolis, who inhabit the adjoining tracts of Gujar&#257;t. The most probable hypothesis of the origin
of the Kolis is that they are a western branch of the Kol or Munda tribe who have spread from Chota N&#257;gpur, through Mandla
and Jubbulpore, Central India and R&#257;jput&#257;na to Gujar&#257;t and the sea. If this is correct the Kolis would be a Kolarian tribe.
The Bh&#299;ls have lost their own language, so that it cannot be ascertained whether it was Kolarian or Dravidian. But there is
nothing against its being Kolarian in Sir G. Grierson&#8217;s opinion; and in view of the length of residence of the tribe, the
fact that they have abandoned their own language and their association with the Kolis, this view may be taken as generally
probable. The Dravidian tribes have not penetrated so far west as Central India and Gujar&#257;t in appreciable numbers.

<h3>2. R&#257;jp&#363;ts deriving their title to the land from the Bh&#299;ls.</h3>
<p>The R&#257;jp&#363;ts still recognise the Bh&#299;ls as the former residents and occupiers of the land by the fact that some R&#257;jp&#363;t chiefs
must be marked on the brow with a Bh&#299;l&#8217;s blood on accession to the <i>Gaddi</i> or regal cushion. Tod relates how Goha,<a id="d0e7739src" href="#d0e7739" class="noteref">2</a> the eponymous ancestor of the Sesodia R&#257;jp&#363;ts, took the state of Idar in Gujar&#257;t from a Bh&#299;l: &#8220;At this period Idar was governed
by a chief of the savage race of Bh&#299;ls. The young Goha frequented the forests in company with the Bh&#299;ls, whose habits better
assimilated with his daring nature than those of the Br&#257;hmans. He became a favourite with these <i>vena-putras</i> or sons of the forest, who resigned to him Idar with its woods and mountains. The Bh&#299;ls having determined in sport to elect
a king, their choice fell on Goha; and one of the young savages, cutting his finger, applied the blood as the badge (<i>t&#299;ka</i>) of sovereignty to his forehead. What was done in sport was confirmed by the old forest chief. The sequel fixes on Goha the
stain of ingratitude, for he slew his <a id="d0e7748"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7748">280</a>]</span>benefactor, and no motive is assigned in the legend for the deed.&#8221;<a id="d0e7750src" href="#d0e7750" class="noteref">3</a>

</p>
<p>The legend is of course a euphemism for the fact that the R&#257;jp&#363;ts conquered and dispossessed the Bh&#299;ls of Idar. But it is
interesting as an indication that they did not consider themselves to derive a proper title to the land merely from the conquest,
but wished also to show that it passed to them by the designation and free consent of the Bh&#299;ls. The explanation is perhaps
that they considered the gods of the Bh&#299;ls to be the tutelary guardians and owners of the land, whom they must conciliate
before they could hope to enjoy it in quiet and prosperity. This token of the devolution of the land from its previous holders,
the Bh&#299;ls, was till recently repeated on the occasion of each succession of a Sesodia chief. &#8220;The Bh&#299;l landholders of Oguna
and Undri still claim the privilege of performing the <i>t&#299;ka</i> for the Sesodias. The Oguna Bh&#299;l makes the mark of sovereignty on the chief&#8217;s forehead with blood drawn from his own thumb,
and then takes the chief by the arm and seats him on the throne, while the Undri Bh&#299;l holds the salver of spices and sacred
grains of rice used in making the badge.&#8221;<a id="d0e7760src" href="#d0e7760" class="noteref">4</a> The story that Goha killed the old Bh&#299;l chief, his benefactor, who had adopted him as heir and successor, which fits in very
badly with the rest of the legend, is probably based on another superstition. Sir J. G. Frazer has shown in <i>The Golden Bough</i> that in ancient times it was a common superstition that any one who killed the king had a right to succeed him. The belief
was that the king was the god of the country, on whose health, strength and efficiency its prosperity depended. When the king
grew old and weak it was time for a successor, and he who could kill the king proved in this manner that the divine power
and strength inherent in the late king had descended to him, and he was therefore the fit person to be king.<a id="d0e7768src" href="#d0e7768" class="noteref">5</a> An almost similar story is told of the way in which the Kachhw&#257;ha R&#257;jp&#363;ts took the territory of Amber State from the M&#299;na
tribe. The infant R&#257;jp&#363;t prince had been deprived of Narwar by <a id="d0e7774"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7774">281</a>]</span>his uncle, and his mother wandered forth carrying him in a basket, till she came to the capital of the M&#299;nas, where she first
obtained employment in the chiefs kitchen. But owing to her good cooking she attracted his wife&#8217;s notice and ultimately disclosed
her identity and told her story. The M&#299;na chief then adopted her as his sister and the boy as his nephew. This boy, Dhola
Rai, on growing up obtained a few R&#257;jp&#363;t adherents and slaughtered all the M&#299;nas while they were bathing at the feast of Diw&#257;li,
after which he usurped their country.<a id="d0e7776src" href="#d0e7776" class="noteref">6</a> The repetition both of the adoption and the ungrateful murder shows the importance attached by the R&#257;jp&#363;ts to both beliefs
as necessary to the validity of their succession and occupation of the land.

</p>
<p>The position of the Bh&#299;ls as the earliest residents of the country was also recognised by their employment in the capacity
of village watchmen. One of the duties of this official is to know the village boundaries and keep watch and ward over them,
and it was supposed that the oldest class of residents would know them best. The Bh&#299;ls worked in the office of M&#257;nkar, the
superior village watchman, in Nim&#257;r and also in Ber&#257;r. Grant Duff states<a id="d0e7783src" href="#d0e7783" class="noteref">7</a> that the R&#257;mosi or Bh&#299;l was employed as village guard by the Mar&#257;thas, and the R&#257;mosis were a professional caste of village
policemen, probably derived from the Bh&#299;ls or from the Bh&#299;ls and Kolis.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7788">
<h3>3. Historical notice.</h3>
<p>The R&#257;jp&#363;ts seem at first to have treated the Bh&#299;ls leniently. Intermarriage was frequent, especially in the families of Bh&#299;l
chieftains, and a new caste called Bhil&#257;la<a id="d0e7793src" href="#d0e7793" class="noteref">8</a> has arisen, which is composed of the descendants of mixed R&#257;jp&#363;t and Bh&#299;l marriages. Chiefs and landholders in the Bh&#299;l country
now belong to this caste, and it is possible that some pure Bh&#299;l families may have been admitted to it. The Bhil&#257;las rank
above the Bh&#299;ls, on a level with the cultivating castes. Instances occasionally occurred in which the children of R&#257;jp&#363;t by
a Bh&#299;l wife became R&#257;jp&#363;ts. When Colonel Tod wrote, R&#257;jp&#363;ts would still take food with Ujla Bh&#299;ls or those of pure aboriginal
descent, and all castes would take water from them.<a id="d0e7796src" href="#d0e7796" class="noteref">9</a> But <a id="d0e7801"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7801">282</a>]</span>as Hinduism came to be more orthodox in R&#257;jput&#257;na, the Bh&#299;ls sank to the position of outcastes. Their custom of eating beef
had always caused them to be much despised. A tradition is related that one day the god Mah&#257;deo or Siva, sick and unhappy,
was reclining in a shady forest when a beautiful woman appeared, the first sight of whom effected a cure of all his complaints.
An intercourse between the god and the strange female was established, the result of which was many children; one of whom,
from infancy distinguished alike by his ugliness and vice, slew the favourite bull of Mah&#257;deo, for which crime he was expelled
to the woods and mountains, and his descendants have ever since been stigmatised by the names of Bh&#299;l and Nish&#257;da.<a id="d0e7803src" href="#d0e7803" class="noteref">10</a> Nish&#257;da is a term of contempt applied to the lowest outcastes. Major Hendley, writing in 1875, states: &#8220;Some time since a
Th&#257;kur (chief) cut off the legs of two Bh&#299;ls, eaters of the sacred cow, and plunged the stumps into boiling oil.&#8221;<a id="d0e7809src" href="#d0e7809" class="noteref">11</a> When the Mar&#257;thas began to occupy Central India they treated the Bh&#299;ls with great cruelty. A Bh&#299;l caught in a disturbed part
of the country was without inquiry flogged and hanged. Hundreds were thrown over high cliffs, and large bodies of them, assembled
under promise of pardon, were beheaded or blown from guns. Their women were mutilated or smothered by smoke, and their children
smashed to death against the stones.<a id="d0e7814src" href="#d0e7814" class="noteref">12</a> This treatment may to some extent have been deserved owing to the predatory habits and cruelty of the Bh&#299;ls, but its result
was to make them utter savages with their hand against every man, as they believed that every one&#8217;s was against them. From
their strongholds in the hills they laid waste the plain country, holding villages and towns to ransom and driving off cattle;
nor did any travellers pass with impunity through the hills except in convoys too large to be attacked. In Kh&#257;ndesh, during
the disturbed period of the wars of Sindhia and Holkar, about <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1800, the Bh&#299;ls betook themselves to highway robbery and lived in bands either in mountains or in villages immediately beneath
them. The revenue contractors were <a id="d0e7822"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7822">283</a>]</span>unable or unwilling to spend money in the maintenance of soldiers to protect the country, and the Bh&#299;ls in a very short time
became so bold as to appear in bands of hundreds and attack towns, carrying off either cattle or hostages, for whom they demanded
handsome ransoms.<a id="d0e7824src" href="#d0e7824" class="noteref">13</a> In Gujar&#257;t another writer described the Bh&#299;ls and Kolis as hereditary and professional plunderers&#8212;&#8216;Soldiers of the night,&#8217;
as they themselves said they were.<a id="d0e7829src" href="#d0e7829" class="noteref">14</a> Malcolm said of them, after peace had been restored to Central India:<a id="d0e7835src" href="#d0e7835" class="noteref">15</a> &#8220;Measures are in progress that will, it is expected, soon complete the reformation of a class of men who, believing themselves
doomed to be thieves and plunderers, have been confirmed in their destiny by the oppression and cruelty of neighbouring governments,
increased by an avowed contempt for them as outcasts. The feeling this system of degradation has produced must be changed;
and no effort has been left untried to restore this race of men to a better sense of their condition than that which they
at present entertain. The common answer of a Bh&#299;l when charged with theft or robbery is, &#8216;I am not to blame; I am the thief
of Mah&#257;deo&#8217;; in other words, &#8216;My destiny as a thief has been fixed by God.&#8217;&#8221; The Bh&#299;l chiefs, who were known as Bhumia, exercised
the most absolute power, and their orders to commit the most atrocious crimes were obeyed by their ignorant but attached subjects
without a conception on the part of the latter that they had an option when he whom they termed their Dhunni (Lord) issued
the mandates.<a id="d0e7840src" href="#d0e7840" class="noteref">16</a> Firearms and swords were only used by the chiefs and headmen of the tribe, and their national weapon was the bamboo bow having
the bowstring made from a thin strip of its elastic bark. The quiver was a piece of strong bamboo matting, and would contain
sixty barbed arrows a yard long, and tipped with an iron spike either flattened and sharpened like a knife or rounded like
a nail; other arrows, used for knocking over birds, had knob-like heads. Thus armed, the Bh&#299;ls would lie in wait in some deep
ravine by the roadside, and an infernal yell announced their attack to the unwary traveller.<a id="d0e7845src" href="#d0e7845" class="noteref">17</a> Major Hendley states <a id="d0e7850"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7850">284</a>]</span>that according to tradition in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata the god Krishna was killed by a Bh&#299;l&#8217;s arrow, when he was fighting against
them in Gujar&#257;t with the Y&#257;davas; and on this account it was ordained that the Bh&#299;l should never again be able to draw the
bow with the forefinger of the right hand. &#8220;Times have changed since then, but I noticed in examining their hands that few
could move the forefinger without the second finger; indeed the fingers appeared useless as independent members of the hands.
In connection with this may be mentioned their apparent inability to distinguish colours or count numbers, due alone to their
want of words to express themselves.&#8221;<a id="d0e7852src" href="#d0e7852" class="noteref">18</a>

<h3>4. General Outram and the Kh&#257;ndesh Bh&#299;l Corps.</h3>
<p>The reclamation and pacification of the Bh&#299;ls is inseparably associated with the name of Lieutenant, afterwards Sir James,
Outram. The Kh&#257;ndesh Bh&#299;l Corps was first raised by him in 1825, when Bh&#299;l robber bands were being hunted down by small parties
of troops, and those who were willing to surrender were granted a free pardon for past offences, and given grants of land
for cultivation and advances for the purchase of seed and bullocks. When the first attempts to raise the corps were made,
the Bh&#299;ls believed that the object was to link them in line like galley-slaves with a view to extirpate the race, that blood
was in high demand as a medicine in the country of their foreign masters, and so on. Indulging the wild men with feasts and
entertainments, and delighting them with his matchless urbanity, Captain Outram at length contrived to draw over to the cause
nine recruits, one of whom was a notorious plunderer who had a short time before successfully robbed the officer commanding
a detachment sent against him. This infant corps soon became strongly attached to the person of their new chief and entirely
devoted to his wishes; their goodwill had been won by his kind and conciliatory manners, while their admiration and respect
had been thoroughly roused and excited by his prowess and valour in the chase. On one occasion, it is recorded, word was brought
to Outram of the presence of a panther in some prickly-pear shrubs on the side of a hill near his station. He went to shoot
it with a friend, Outram being on foot and his friend on horseback searching <a id="d0e7866"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7866">285</a>]</span>through the bushes. When close on the animal, Outram&#8217;s friend fired and missed, on which the panther sprang forward roaring
and seized Outram, and they rolled down the hill together. Being released from the claws of the furious beast for a moment,
Outram with great presence of mind drew a pistol which he had with him, and shot the panther dead. The Bh&#299;ls, on seeing that
he had been injured, were one and all loud in their grief and expressions of regret, when Outram quieted them with the remark,
&#8216;What do I care for the clawing of a cat?&#8217; and this saying long remained a proverb among the Bh&#299;ls.<a id="d0e7868src" href="#d0e7868" class="noteref">19</a> By his kindness and sympathy, listening freely to all that each single man in the corps had to say to him, Outram at length
won their confidence, convinced them of his good faith and dissipated their fears of treachery. Soon the ranks of the corps
became full, and for every vacant place there were numbers of applicants. The Bh&#299;ls freely hunted down and captured their
friends and relations who continued to create disturbances, and brought them in for punishment. Outram managed to check their
propensity for liquor by paying them every day just sufficient for their food, and giving them the balance of their pay at
the end of the month, when some might have a drinking bout, but many preferred to spend the money on ornaments and articles
of finery. With the assistance of the corps the marauding tendencies of the hill Bh&#299;ls were suppressed and tranquillity restored
to Kh&#257;ndesh, which rapidly became one of the most fertile parts of India. During the Mutiny the Bh&#299;l corps remained loyal,
and did good service in checking the local outbursts which occurred in Kh&#257;ndesh. A second battalion was raised at this time,
but was disbanded three years afterwards. After this the corps had little or nothing to do, and as the absence of fighting
and the higher wages which could be obtained by ordinary labour ceased to render it attractive to the Bh&#299;ls, it was finally
converted into police in 1891.<a id="d0e7873src" href="#d0e7873" class="noteref">20</a>

<h3>5. Subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The Bh&#299;ls of the Central Provinces have now only two subdivisions, the Muhammadan Bh&#299;ls, who were forcibly converted to Isl&#257;m
during the time of Aur&#257;ngzeb, and the remainder, who though retaining many animistic beliefs and <a id="d0e7883"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7883">286</a>]</span>superstitions, have practically become Hindus. The Muhammadan Bh&#299;ls only number about 3000 out of 28,000. They are known as
Tadvi, a name which was formerly applied to a Bh&#299;l headman, and is said to be derived from <i>t&#257;d</i>, meaning a separate branch or section. These Bh&#299;ls marry among themselves and not with any other Muhammadans. They retain
many Hindu and animistic usages, and are scarcely Muhammadan in more than name. Both classes are divided into groups or septs,
generally named after plants or animals to which they still show reverence. Thus the J&#257;mania sept, named after the <i>j&#257;man</i> tree,<a id="d0e7891src" href="#d0e7891" class="noteref">21</a> will not cut or burn any part of this tree, and at their weddings the dresses of the bride and bridegroom are taken and rubbed
against the tree before being worn. Similarly the Rohini sept worship the <i>rohan</i><a id="d0e7897src" href="#d0e7897" class="noteref">22</a> tree, the Avalia sept the <i>aonla</i><a id="d0e7903src" href="#d0e7903" class="noteref">23</a> tree, the Meheda sept the <i>bahera</i><a id="d0e7909src" href="#d0e7909" class="noteref">24</a> tree, and so on. The Mori sept worship the peacock. They go into the jungle and look for the tracks of a peacock, and spreading
a piece of red cloth before the footprint, lay their offerings of grain upon it. Members of this sept may not be tattooed,
because they think the splashes of colour on the peacock&#8217;s feathers are tattoo-marks. Their women must veil themselves if
they see a peacock, and they think that if any member of the sept irreverently treads on a peacock&#8217;s footprints he will fall
ill. The Ghodm&#257;rya (Horse-killer) sept may not tame a horse nor ride one. The Masrya sept will not kill or eat fish. The Sany&#257;n
or cat sept have a tradition that one of their ancestors was once chasing a cat, which ran for protection under a cover which
had been put over the stone figure of their goddess. The goddess turned the cat into stone and sat on it, and since then members
of the sept will not touch a cat except to save it from harm, and they will not eat anything which has been touched by a cat.
The Ghattaya sept worship the grinding mill at their weddings and also on festival days. The Solia sept, whose name is apparently
derived from the sun, are split up into four subsepts: the Ada Solia, who hold their weddings at sunrise; the Japa Solia,
who hold them at sunset; the Taria Solia, <a id="d0e7913"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7913">287</a>]</span>who hold them when stars have become visible after sunset; and the Tar Solia, who believe their name is connected with cotton
thread and wrap several skeins of raw thread round the bride and bridegroom at the wedding ceremony. The Moharia sept worship
the local goddess at the village of Moharia in Indore State, who is known as the Moharia M&#257;ta; at their weddings they apply
turmeric and oil to the fingers of the goddess before rubbing them on the bride and bridegroom. The Maoli sept worship a goddess
of that name in Barw&#257;ni town. Her shrine is considered to be in the shape of a kind of grain-basket known as <i>kilia</i>, and members of the sept may never make or use baskets of this shape, nor may they be tattooed with representations of it.
Women of the sept are not allowed to visit the shrine of the goddess, but may worship her at home. Several septs have the
names of R&#257;jp&#363;t clans, as Sesodia, Panw&#257;r, Mori, and appear to have originated in mixed unions between R&#257;jp&#363;ts and Bh&#299;ls.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7918">
<h3>6. Exogamy and marriage customs.</h3>
<p>A man must not marry in his own sept nor in the families of his mothers and grandmothers. The union of first cousins is thus
prohibited, nor can girls be exchanged in marriage between two families. A wife&#8217;s sister may also not be married during the
wife&#8217;s lifetime. The Muhammadan Bh&#299;ls permit a man to marry his maternal uncle&#8217;s daughter, and though he cannot marry his
wife&#8217;s sister he may keep her as a concubine. Marriages may be infant or adult, but the former practice is becoming prevalent
and girls are often wedded before they are eleven. Matches are arranged by the parents of the parties in consultation with
the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i>; but in Bombay girls may select their own husbands, and they have also a recognised custom of elopement at the Tosina fair
in the month of the Mahi K&#257;ntha. If a Bh&#299;l can persuade a girl to cross the river there with him he may claim her as his wife;
but if they are caught before getting across he is liable to be punished by the bride&#8217;s father.<a id="d0e7926src" href="#d0e7926" class="noteref">25</a> The betrothal and wedding ceremonies now follow the ordinary ritual of the middle and lower castes in the Mar&#257;tha country.<a id="d0e7931src" href="#d0e7931" class="noteref">26</a> The bride must be <a id="d0e7934"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7934">288</a>]</span>younger than the bridegroom except in the case of a widow. A bride-price is paid which may vary from Rs. 9 to 20; in the case
of Muhammadan Bh&#299;ls the bridegroom is said to give a dowry of Rs. 20 to 25. When the ovens are made with the sacred earth
they roast some of the large millet ju&#257;ri<a id="d0e7936src" href="#d0e7936" class="noteref">27</a> for the family feast, calling this Ju&#257;ri M&#257;ta or the grain goddess. Offerings of this are made to the family gods, and it
is partaken of only by the members of the bride&#8217;s and bridegroom&#8217;s septs respectively at their houses. No outsider may even
see this food being eaten. The leavings of food, with the leaf-plates on which it was eaten, are buried inside the house,
as it is believed that if they should fall into the hands of any outsider the death or blindness of one of the family will
ensue. When the bridegroom reaches the bride&#8217;s house he strikes the marriage-shed with a dagger or other sharp instrument.
A goat is killed and he steps in its blood as he enters the shed. A day for the wedding is selected by the priest, but it
may also take place on any Sunday in the eight fine months. If the wedding takes place on the eleventh day of K&#257;rtik, that
is on the expiration of the four rainy months when marriages are forbidden, they make a little hut of eleven stalks of ju&#257;ri
with their cobs in the shape of a cone, and the bride and bridegroom walk round this. The services of a Br&#257;hman are not required
for such a wedding. Sometimes the bridegroom is simply seated in a grain basket and the bride in a winnowing-fan; then their
hands are joined as the sun is half set, and the marriage is completed. The bridegroom takes the basket and fan home with
him. On the return of the wedding couple, their <i>kankans</i> or wristbands are taken off at Hanum&#257;n&#8217;s temple. The Muhammadan Bh&#299;ls perform the same ceremonies as the Hindus, but at the
end they call in the K&#257;zi or registrar, who repeats the Muhammadan prayers and records the dowry agreed upon. The practice
of the bridegroom serving for his wife is in force among both classes of Bh&#299;ls.

<div class="div2" id="d0e7943">
<h3>7. Widow&#8212;marriage, divorce and polygamy.</h3>
<p>The remarriage of widows is permitted, but the widow may not marry any relative of her first husband. She returns to her father&#8217;s
house, and on her remarriage they <a id="d0e7948"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7948">289</a>]</span>obtain a bride-price of Rs. 40 or 50, a quarter of which goes in a feast to the tribesmen. The wedding of a widow is held
on the Am&#257;was or last day of the dark fortnight of the month, or on a Sunday. A wife may be divorced for adultery without
consulting the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>. It is said that a wife cannot otherwise be divorced on any account, nor can a woman divorce her husband, but she may desert
him and go and live with a man. In this case all that is necessary is that the second husband should repay to the first as
compensation the amount expended by the latter on his marriage with the woman. Polygamy is permitted, and a second wife is
sometimes taken in order to obtain children, but this number is seldom if ever exceeded. It is stated that the Bh&#299;l married
women are generally chaste and faithful to their husbands, and any attempt to tamper with their virtue on the part of an outsider
is strongly resented by the man.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7953">
<h3>8. Religion.</h3>
<p>The Bh&#299;ls worship the ordinary Hindu deities and the village godlings of the locality. The favourite both with Hindu and Muhammadan
Bh&#299;ls is Khande Rao or Khandoba, the war-god of the Mar&#257;thas, who is often represented by a sword. The Muhammadans and the
Hindu Bh&#299;ls also to a less extent worship the P&#299;rs or spirits of Muhammadan saints at their tombs, of which there are a number
in Nim&#257;r. Major Hendley states that in Mew&#257;r the seats or <i>sth&#257;ns</i> of the Bh&#299;l gods are on the summits of high hills, and are represented by heaps of stones, solid or hollowed out in the centre,
or mere platforms, in or near which are found numbers of clay or mud images of horses.<a id="d0e7961src" href="#d0e7961" class="noteref">28</a> In some places clay lamps are burnt in front of the images of horses, from which it may be concluded that the horse itself
is or was worshipped as a god. Colonel Tod states that the Bh&#299;ls will eat of nothing white in colour, as a white sheep or
goat; and their grand adjuration is &#8216;By the white ram.&#8217;<a id="d0e7966src" href="#d0e7966" class="noteref">29</a> Sir A. Lyall<a id="d0e7970src" href="#d0e7970" class="noteref">30</a> says that their principal oath is by the dog. The Bh&#299;l sepoys told Major Hendley that they considered it of little use to
go on worshipping their own gods, as the power of these had declined since the English became supreme. They thought the strong
English gods were too much for <a id="d0e7975"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7975">290</a>]</span>the weak deities of their country, hence they were desirous of embracing Br&#257;hmanism, which would also raise them in the social
scale and give them a better chance of promotion in regiments where there were Br&#257;hman officers.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e7977">
<h3>9. Witchcraft and amulets.</h3>
<p>They wear charms and amulets to keep off evil spirits; the charms are generally pieces of blue string with seven knots in
them, which their witch-finder or Badwa ties, reciting an incantation on each; the knots were sometimes covered with metal
to keep them undefiled and the charms were tied on at the Holi, Dasahra or some other festival.<a id="d0e7982src" href="#d0e7982" class="noteref">31</a> In Bombay the Bh&#299;ls still believe in witches as the agents of any misfortunes that may befall them. If a man was sick and
thought some woman had bewitched him, the suspected woman was thrown into a stream or swung from a tree. If the branch broke
and the woman fell and suffered serious injury, or if she could not swim across the stream and sank, she was considered to
be innocent and efforts were made to save her. But if she escaped without injury she was held to be a witch, and it frequently
happened that the woman would admit herself to be one either from fear of the infliction of a harder ordeal, or to keep up
the belief in her powers as a witch, which often secured her a free supper of milk and chickens. She would then admit that
she had really bewitched the sick man and undertake to cure him on some sacrifice being made. If he recovered, the animal
named by the witch was sacrificed and its blood given her to drink while still warm; either from fear or in order to keep
up the character she would drink it, and would be permitted to stay on in the village. If, on the other hand, the sick person
died, the witch would often be driven into the forest to die of hunger or to be devoured by wild animals.<a id="d0e7987src" href="#d0e7987" class="noteref">32</a> These practices have now disappeared in the Central Provinces, though occasionally murders of suspected witches may still
occur. The Bh&#299;ls are firm believers in omens, the nature of which is much the same as among the Hindus. When a Bh&#299;l is persistently
unlucky in hunting, he sometimes says &#8216;<i lang="und">Nat laga</i>,&#8217; meaning that some bad spirit is causing his ill-success. Then he will <a id="d0e7995"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7995">291</a>]</span>make an image of a man in the sand or dust of the road, or sometimes two images of a man and woman, and throwing straw or
grass over the images set it alight, and pound it down on them with a stick with abusive yells. This he calls killing his
bad luck.<a id="d0e7997src" href="#d0e7997" class="noteref">33</a> Major Hendley notes that the men danced before the different festivals and before battles. The men danced in a ring holding
sticks and striking them against each other, much like the Baiga dance. Before battle they had a war-dance in which the performers
were armed and imitated a combat. To be carried on the shoulders of one of the combatants was a great honour, perhaps because
it symbolised being on horseback. The dance was probably in the nature of a magical rite, designed to obtain success in battle
by going through an imitation of it beforehand. The priests are the chief physicians among the Bh&#299;ls, though most old men
were supposed to know something about medicine.<a id="d0e8002src" href="#d0e8002" class="noteref">34</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8007">
<h3>10. Funeral rites.</h3>
<p>The dead are usually buried lying on the back, with the head pointing to the south. Cooked food is placed on the bier and
deposited on the ground half-way to the cemetery. On return each family of the sept brings a wheaten cake to the mourners
and these are eaten. On the third day they place on the grave a thick cake of wheaten flour, water in an earthen pot and tobacco
or any other stimulant which the deceased was in the habit of using in his life.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8012">
<h3>11. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The Hindu Bh&#299;ls say that they do not admit outsiders into the caste, but the Muhammadans will admit a man of any but the impure
castes. The neophyte must be shaved and circumcised, and the K&#257;zi gives him some holy water to drink and teaches him the profession
of belief in Isl&#257;m. If a man is not circumcised, the Tadvi or Muhammadan Bh&#299;ls will not bury his body. Both classes of Bh&#299;ls
employ Br&#257;hmans at their ceremonies. The tribe eat almost all kinds of flesh and drink liquor, but the Hindus now abjure beef
and the Muhammadans pork. Some Bh&#299;ls now refuse to take the skins off dead cattle, but others will do so. The Bh&#299;ls will take
food from any caste except the impure ones, and none except these castes will now take food from <a id="d0e8017"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8017">292</a>]</span>them. Temporary or permanent exclusion from caste is imposed for the same offences as among the Hindus.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8019">
<h3>12. Appearance and characteristics.</h3>
<p>The typical Bh&#299;l is small, dark, broad-nosed and ugly, but well built and active. The average height of 128 men measured by
Major Hendley was 5 feet 6.4 inches. The hands are somewhat small and the legs fairly developed, those of the women being
the best. &#8220;The Bh&#299;l is an excellent woodsman, knows the shortest cuts over the hills, can walk the roughest paths and climb
the steepest crags without slipping or feeling distressed. He is often called in old Sanskrit works Venaputra, &#8216;child of the
forest,&#8217; or P&#257;l Indra, &#8216;lord of the pass.&#8217; These names well describe his character. His country is approached through narrow
defiles (<i>p&#257;l</i>), and through these none could pass without his permission. In former days he always levied <i>rakhw&#257;li</i> or blackmail, and even now native travellers find him quite ready to assert what he deems his just rights. The Bh&#299;l is a
capital huntsman, tracking and marking down tigers, panthers and bears, knowing all their haunts, the best places to shoot
them, the paths they take and all those points so essential to success in big-game shooting; they will remember for years
the spots where tigers have been disposed of, and all the circumstances connected with their deaths. The Bh&#299;l will himself
attack a leopard, and with his sword, aided by his friends, cut him to pieces.&#8221;<a id="d0e8030src" href="#d0e8030" class="noteref">35</a> Their agility impressed the Hindus, and an old writer says: &#8220;Some Bh&#299;l chieftains who attended the camp of Sidhr&#257;j, king
of Gujar&#257;t, astonished him with their feats of activity; in his army they seemed as the followers of Hanum&#257;n in attendance
upon R&#257;m.&#8221;<a id="d0e8035src" href="#d0e8035" class="noteref">36</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8041">
<h3>13. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The Bh&#299;ls have now had to abandon their free use of the forests, which was highly destructive in its effects, and their indiscriminate
slaughter of game. Many of them live in the open country and have become farmservants and field-labourers. A certain proportion
are tenants, but very few own villages. Some of the Tadvi Bh&#299;ls, however, still retain villages which were originally granted
free of revenue on condition of their keeping the hill-passes of the Satp&#363;ras <a id="d0e8046"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8046">293</a>]</span>open and safe for travellers. These are known as Hattiw&#257;la. Bh&#299;ls also serve as village watchmen in Nim&#257;r and the adjoining
tracts of the Ber&#257;r Districts. Captain Forsyth, writing in 1868, described the Bh&#299;ls as follows: &#8220;The Muhammadan Bh&#299;ls are
with few exceptions a miserable lot, idle and thriftless, and steeped in the deadly vice of opium-eating. The unconverted
Bh&#299;ls are held to be tolerably reliable. When they borrow money or stock for cultivation they seldom abscond fraudulently
from their creditors, and this simple honesty of theirs tends, I fear, to keep numbers of them still in a state little above
serfdom.&#8221;<a id="d0e8048src" href="#d0e8048" class="noteref">37</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8053">
<h3>14. Language.</h3>
<p>The Bh&#299;ls have now entirely abandoned their own language and speak a corrupt dialect based on the Aryan vernaculars current
around them. The Bh&#299;l dialect is mainly derived from Gujar&#257;ti, but it is influenced by M&#257;rw&#257;ri and Mar&#257;thi; in Nim&#257;r especially
it becomes a corrupt form of Mar&#257;thi. Bh&#299;li, as this dialect is called, contains a number of non-Aryan words, some of which
appear to come from the Mund&#257;ri, and others from the Dravidian languages; but these are insufficient to form any basis for
a deduction as to whether the Bh&#299;ls belonged to the Kolarian or Dravidian race.<a id="d0e8058src" href="#d0e8058" class="noteref">38</a>

</span><h2>Bhil&#257;la</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8067">
<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Bhil&#257;la</b>,<a id="d0e8074src" href="#d0e8074" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A small caste found in the Nim&#257;r and Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d Districts of the Central Provinces and in Central India. The total strength
of the Bhil&#257;las is about 150,000 persons, most of whom reside in the Bhop&#257;w&#257;r Agency, adjoining Nim&#257;r. Only 15,000 were returned
from the Central Provinces in 1911. The Bhil&#257;las are commonly considered, and the general belief may in their case be accepted
as correct, to be a mixed caste sprung from the alliances of immigrant R&#257;jp&#363;ts with the Bh&#299;ls of the Central India hills.
The original term was not improbably Bh&#299;lw&#257;la, and may have been applied to those R&#257;jp&#363;t chiefs, a numerous body, who acquired
small estates in the Bh&#299;l country, or to those who took the daughters of Bh&#299;l chieftains to wife, the second course being
often no <a id="d0e8080"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8080">294</a>]</span>doubt a necessary preliminary to the first. Several Bhil&#257;la families hold estates in Nim&#257;r and Indore, and their chiefs now
claim to be pure R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The principal Bhil&#257;la houses, as those of Bh&#257;mgarh, Sel&#257;ni and Mandh&#257;ta, do not intermarry with
the rest of the caste, but only among themselves and with other families of the same standing in M&#257;lwa and Holkar&#8217;s Nim&#257;r.
On succession to the <i>Gaddi</i> or headship of the house, representatives of these families are marked with a <i>t&#299;ka</i> or badge on the forehead and sometimes presented with a sword, and the investiture may be carried out by custom by the head
of another house. Bhil&#257;la landholders usually have the title of Rao or R&#257;wat. They do not admit that a Bhil&#257;la can now spring
from intermarriage between a R&#257;jp&#363;t and a Bh&#299;l. The local Br&#257;hmans will take water from them and they are occasionally invested
with the sacred thread at the time of marriage. The Bhil&#257;la Rao of Mandh&#257;ta is hereditary custodian of the great shrine of
Siva at Onk&#257;r Mandh&#257;ta on an island in the Nerbudda. According to the traditions of the family, their ancestor, Bh&#257;rat Singh,
was a Chauh&#257;n R&#257;jp&#363;t, who took Mandh&#257;ta from N&#257;thu Bh&#299;l in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1165, and restored the worship of Siva to the island, which had been made inaccessible to pilgrims by the terrible deities,
K&#257;li and Bhairava, devourers of human flesh. In such legends may be recognised the propagation of Hinduism by the R&#257;jp&#363;t adventurers
and the reconsecration of the aboriginal shrines to its deities. Bh&#257;rat Singh is said to have killed N&#257;thu Bh&#299;l, but it is
more probable that he only married his daughter and founded a Bhil&#257;la family. Similar alliances have taken place among other
tribes, as the Korku chiefs of the G&#257;wilgarh and Mah&#257;deo hills, and the Gond princes of Garha Mandla. The Bhil&#257;las generally
resemble other Hindus in appearance, showing no marked signs of aboriginal descent. Very probably they have all an infusion
of R&#257;jp&#363;t blood, as the R&#257;jp&#363;ts settled in the Bh&#299;l country in some strength at an early period of history. The caste have,
however, totemistic group names; they will eat fowls and drink liquor; and they bury their dead with the feet to the north,
all these customs indicating a Dravidian origin. Their subordinate position in past times is shown by the fact that they will
accept cooked food from a Kunbi <a id="d0e8091"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8091">295</a>]</span>or a G&#363;jar; and indeed the status of all except the chief&#8217;s families would naturally have been a low one, as they were practically
the offspring of kept women. As already stated, the landowning families usually arrange alliances among themselves. Below
these comes the body of the caste and below them is a group known as the Chhoti Tad or bastard Bhil&#257;las, to which are relegated
the progeny of irregular unions and persons expelled from the caste for social offences.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8093">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>The caste, for the purpose of avoiding marriages between relations, are also divided into exogamous groups called <i>kul</i> or <i>kuri</i>, several of the names of which are of totemistic origin or derived from those of animals and plants. Members of the J&#257;mra
<i>kuri</i> will not cut or burn the <i>j&#257;mun</i><a id="d0e8109src" href="#d0e8109" class="noteref">2</a> tree; those of the Saniy&#257;r <i>kuri</i> will not grow <i>san</i>-hemp, while the Astaryas revere the <i>sona</i><a id="d0e8121src" href="#d0e8121" class="noteref">3</a> tree and the Pipal&#257;dya, the <i>p&#299;pal</i> tree. Some of the <i>kuris</i> have R&#257;jp&#363;t sept names, as Mori, Baghel and Solanki. A man is forbidden to take a wife from within his own sept or that of
his mother, and the union of first cousins is also prohibited. The customs of the Bhil&#257;las resemble those of the Kunbis and
other cultivating castes. At their weddings four cart-yokes are arranged in a square, and inside this are placed two copper
vessels filled with water and considered to represent the Ganges and Jumna. When the sun is half set, the bride and the bridegroom
clasp hands and then walk seven times round the square of cart-yokes. The water of the pots is mixed and this is considered
to represent the mingling of the bride&#8217;s and bridegroom&#8217;s personalities as the Ganges and Jumna meet at Allah&#257;b&#257;d. A sum of
about Rs. 60 is usually paid by the parents of the bridegroom to those of the bride and is expended on the ceremony. The ordinary
Bhil&#257;l&#257;s have, Mr. Korke states, a simple form of wedding which may be gone through without consulting a Br&#257;hman on the Ek&#257;dashi
or eleventh of K&#257;rtik (October); this is the day on which the gods awake from sleep and marks the commencement of the marriage
season. A cone is erected of eleven plants of ju&#257;ri, roots and all, and the couple simply walk round this seven times at night,
when the marriage is complete. The <a id="d0e8131"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8131">296</a>]</span>remarriage of widows is permitted. The woman&#8217;s forehead is marked with cowdung by another widow, probably as a rite of purification,
and the cloths of the couple are tied together.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8133">
<h3>3. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The caste commonly bury the dead and erect memorial stones at the heads of graves which they worship in the month of Chait
(April), smearing them with vermilion and making an offering of flowers. This may either be a Dravidian usage or have been
adopted by imitation from the Muhammadans. The caste worship the ordinary Hindu deities, but each family has a <i>Kul-devi</i> or household god, Mr. Korke remarks, to which they pay special reverence. The offerings made to the Kul-devi must be consumed
by the family alone, but married daughters are allowed to participate. They employ Nim&#257;ri Br&#257;hmans as their priests, and also
have <i>gurus</i> or spiritual preceptors, who are Gosains or Bair&#257;gis. They will take food cooked with water from Br&#257;hmans, R&#257;jp&#363;ts, Munda
G&#363;jars and Tirole Kunbis. The last two groups are principal agricultural castes of the locality and the Bhil&#257;las are probably
employed by them as farmservants, and hence accept cooked food from their masters in accordance with a common custom. The
local Br&#257;hmans of the N&#257;gar, N&#257;ramdeo, Ba&#299;sa and other subcastes will take water from the hand of a Bhil&#257;la. Temporary excommunication
from caste is imposed for the usual offences, such as going to jail, getting maggots in a wound, killing a cow, a dog or a
squirrel, committing homicide, being beaten by a man of low caste, selling shoes at a profit, committing adultery, and allowing
a cow to die with a rope round its neck; and further, for touching the corpses of a cow, cat or horse, or a Barhai (carpenter)
or Cham&#257;r (tanner). They will not swear by a dog, a cat or a squirrel, and if either of the first two animals dies in a house,
it is considered to be impure for a month and a quarter. The head of the caste committee has the designation of Mandloi, which
is a territorial title borne by several families in Nim&#257;r. He receives a share of the fine levied for the <i>Sarni</i> or purification ceremony, when a person temporarily expelled is readmitted into caste. Under the Mandloi is the Kotw&#257;l whose
business is to summon the members to the caste <a id="d0e8147"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8147">297</a>]</span>assemblies; he also is paid out of the fines and his office is hereditary.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8149">
<h3>4. Occupation and character.</h3>
<p>The caste are cultivators, farmservants and field-labourers, and a Bhil&#257;la also usually held the office of M&#257;nkar, a superior
kind of Kotw&#257;r or village watchman. The M&#257;nkar did no dirty work and would not touch hides, but attended on any officer who
came to the village and acted as a guide. Where there was a village <i>sarai</i> or rest-house, it was in charge of the M&#257;nkar, who was frequently also known as zam&#299;nd&#257;r. This may have been a recognition
of the ancient rights of the Bhil&#257;las and Bh&#299;ls to the country.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8157">
<h3>5. Character.</h3>
<p>Captain Forsyth, Settlement Officer of Nim&#257;r, had a very unfavourable opinion of the Bhil&#257;las, whom he described as proverbial
for dishonesty in agricultural engagements and worse drunkards than any of the indigenous tribes.<a id="d0e8162src" href="#d0e8162" class="noteref">4</a> This judgment was probably somewhat too severe, but they are poor cultivators, and a Bhil&#257;la&#8217;s field may often be recognised
by its slovenly appearance.<a id="d0e8167src" href="#d0e8167" class="noteref">5</a>

</p>
<p>A century ago Sir J. Malcolm also wrote very severely of the Bhil&#257;las: &#8220;The Bhil&#257;la and Lundi chiefs were the only robbers
in M&#257;lwa whom under no circumstances travellers could trust. There are oaths of a sacred but obscure kind among those that
are R&#257;jp&#363;ts or who boast their blood, which are almost a disgrace to take, but which, they assert, the basest was never known
to break before Mandrup Singh, a Bhil&#257;la, and some of his associates, plunderers on the Nerbudda, showed the example. The
vanity of this race has lately been flattered by their having risen into such power and consideration that neighbouring R&#257;jp&#363;t
chiefs found it their interest to forget their prejudices and to condescend so far as to eat and drink with them. Hatti Singh,
Grassia chief of Nowl&#257;na, a Kh&#299;chi R&#257;jp&#363;t, and several others in the vicinity cultivated the friendship of N&#257;dir, the late
formidable Bhil&#257;la robber-chief of the Vindhya range; and among other sacrifices made by the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, was eating and drinking
with him. On seeing this take place in my camp, I asked Hatti Singh whether he was not degraded by doing so; he said no, but
that N&#257;dir was elevated.&#8221;<a id="d0e8175src" href="#d0e8175" class="noteref">6</a>

</span><h2>Bhishti</h2>
<p><b>Bhishti.</b>&#8212;A small Muhammadan caste of water-bearers. Only 26 Bhishtis were shown in the Central Provinces in 1901 and 278 in 1891.
The tendency of the lower Muhammadan castes, as they obtain some education, is to return themselves simply as Muhammadans,
the caste name being considered derogatory. The Bhishtis are, however, a regular caste numbering over a lakh of persons in
India, the bulk of whom belong to the United Provinces. Many of them are converts from Hinduism, and they combine Hindu and
Muhammadan practices. They have <i>gotras</i> or exogamous sections, the names of which indicate the Hindu origin of their members, as Huseni Br&#257;hman, Samri Chauh&#257;n, Bahmangour
and others. They prohibit marriage within the section and within two degrees of relationship on the mother&#8217;s side. Marriages
are performed by the Muhammadan ritual or Nik&#257;h, but a Br&#257;hman is sometimes asked to fix the auspicious day, and they erect
a marriage-shed. The bridegroom goes to the bride&#8217;s house riding on a horse, and when he arrives drops Rs. 1&#8211;4 into a pot
of water held by a woman. The bride whips the bridegroom&#8217;s horse with a switch made of flowers. During the marriage the bride
sits inside the house and the bridegroom in the shed outside. An agent or Vak&#299;l with two witnesses goes to the bride and asks
her whether she consents to marry the bridegroom, and when she gives her consent, as she always does, they go out and formally
communicate it to the K&#257;zi. The dowry is then settled, and the bond of marriage is sealed. But when the parents of the bride
are poor they receive a bride-price of Rs. 30, from which they pay the dowry. The Bhishtis worship their leather bag (<i>mashk</i>) as a sort of fetish, and burn incense before it on Fridays.<a id="d0e8194src" href="#d0e8194" class="noteref">1</a> The traditional occupation of the Bhishti is to supply water, and he is still engaged in this and other kinds of domestic
service. The name is said to be derived from the Persian <i>bihisht</i>, &#8216;paradise,&#8217; and to have been given to them on account of the relief which their ministrations afforded to the thirsty soldiery.<a id="d0e8203src" href="#d0e8203" class="noteref">2</a> Perhaps, too, the grandiloquent name was applied partly in derision, <a id="d0e8209"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8209">299</a>]</span>like similar titles given to other menial servants. They are also known as Mashki or Pakh&#257;li, after their leathern water-bag.
The leather bag is a distinctive sign of the Bhishti, but when he puts it away he may be recognised from the piece of red
cloth which he usually wears round his waist. There is an interesting legend to the effect that the Bhishti who saved the
Emperor Humayun&#8217;s life at Chausa, and was rewarded by the tenure of the Imperial throne for half a day, employed his short
lease of power by providing for his family and friends, and caused his leather bag to be cut up into rupees, which were gilded
and stamped with the record of his date and reign in order to perpetuate its memory.<a id="d0e8211src" href="#d0e8211" class="noteref">3</a> The story of the Bhishti obtaining his name on account of the solace which he afforded to the Muhammadan soldiery finds a
parallel in the case of the English army:

<p>An excellent description of the Bhishti as a household servant is contained in Eha&#8217;s <i>Behind the Bungalow</i>,<a id="d0e8253src" href="#d0e8253" class="noteref">5</a> from which the following extract is taken: &#8220;If you ask: Who is the Bhishti? I will tell you. Bihisht in the Persian tongue
means Paradise, and a Bihishtee is therefore an inhabitant of Paradise, a cherub, a seraph, an angel of mercy. He has no wings;
the painters have misconceived him; but his back is bowed down with the burden of a great goat-skin swollen to bursting with
the elixir of life. He walks the land when the heaven above him is brass and the earth iron, when the trees and shrubs are
languishing and the last blade <a id="d0e8256"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8256">300</a>]</span>of grass has given up the struggle for life, when the very roses smell only of dust, and all day long the roaming dust-devils
waltz about the fields, whirling leaf and grass and cornstalk round and round and up and away into the regions of the sky;
and he unties a leather thong which chokes the throat of his goat-skin just where the head of the poor old goat was cut off,
and straightway, with a life-reviving gurgle, the stream called <i>thandha p&#257;ni</i> gushes forth, and plant and shrub lift up their heads and the garden smiles again. The dust also on the roads is laid, and
a grateful incense rises from the ground, the sides of the water <i>chatti</i> grow dark and moist and cool themselves in the hot air, and through the dripping interstices of the <i>khaskhas</i> tattie a chilly fragrance creeps into the room, causing the mercury in the thermometer to retreat from its proud place. I
like the Bhishti and respect him. As a man he is temperate and contented, eating <i>b&#257;jri</i> bread and slaking his thirst with his own element. And as a servant he is laborious and faithful, rarely shirking his work,
seeking it out rather. For example, we had a bottle-shaped filter of porous stoneware, standing in a bucket of water which
it was his duty to fill daily; but the good man, not content with doing his bare duty, took the plug out of the filter and
filled it too. And all the station knows how assiduously he fills the rain-gauge.&#8221; With the construction of water-works in
large stations the Bhishti is losing his occupation, and he is a far less familiar figure to the present generation of Anglo-Indians
than to their predecessors.

</span><h2>Bhoyar</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8273">
<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Bhoyar,<a id="d0e8279src" href="#d0e8279" class="noteref">1</a> Bhoir</b> (Honorific titles, Mah&#257;jan and Patel).&#8212;A cultivating caste numbering nearly 60,000 persons in 1911, and residing principally
in the Bet&#363;l and Chh&#299;ndw&#257;ra Districts. The Bhoyars are not found outside the Central Provinces. They claim to be the descendants
of a band of Panw&#257;r R&#257;jp&#363;ts, who were defending the town of Dh&#257;r&#257;nagri or Dh&#257;r in Central India when it was besieged by Aur&#257;ngzeb.
Their post was on the western part of the wall, but they gave way and fled into the town as the sun was rising, and it <a id="d0e8283"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8283">301</a>]</span>shone on their faces. Hence they were called Bhoyar from a word <i>bhor</i> meaning morning, because they were seen running away in the morning. They were put out of caste by the other R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and
fled to the Central Provinces. The name may also be a variant of that of the Bhagore R&#257;jp&#363;ts. And another derivation is from
<i>bhora</i>, a simpleton or timid person. Their claim to be immigrants from Central India is borne out by the fact that they still speak
a corrupt form of the M&#257;lwi dialect of R&#257;jput&#257;na, which is called after them Bhoyari, and their Bh&#257;ts or genealogists come
from M&#257;lwa. But they have now entirely lost their position as R&#257;jp&#363;ts.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8291">
<h3>2. Subcastes and sections.</h3>
<p>The Bhoyars are divided into the Panw&#257;ri, Dholew&#257;r, Chaur&#257;sia and Daharia subcastes. The Panw&#257;rs are the most numerous and
the highest, as claiming to be directly descended from Panw&#257;r R&#257;jp&#363;ts. They sometimes called themselves Jagdeo Panw&#257;rs, Jagdeo
being the name of the king under whom they served in Dh&#257;r&#257;nagri. The Dholew&#257;rs take their name from Dhola, a place in M&#257;lwa,
or from <i>dhol</i>, a drum. They are the lowest subcaste, and some of them keep pigs. It is probable that these subcastes immigrated with the
M&#257;lwa R&#257;jas in the fifteenth century, the Dholew&#257;rs being the earlier arrivals, and having from the first intermarried with
the local Dravidian tribes. The Daharias take their name from D&#257;har, the old name of the Jubbulpore country, and may be a
relic of the domination of the Chedi kings of Tewar. The name of the Chaur&#257;sias is probably derived from the Chaur&#257;si or tract
of eighty-four villages formerly held by the Bet&#363;l Korku family of Ch&#257;ndu. The last two subdivisions are numerically unimportant.
The Bhoyars have over a hundred <i>kuls</i> or exogamous sections. The names of most of these are titular, but some are territorial and a few totemistic. Instances of
such names are Onk&#257;r (the god Siva), Deshmukh and Chaudhari, headman, Haz&#257;ri (a leader of 1000 horse), Gore (fair-coloured),
Dongardiya (a lamp on a hill), Pinj&#257;ra (a cotton-cleaner), G&#257;dria (a shepherd), Khaparia (a tyler), Khaw&#257;si (a barber), Chikny&#257;
(a sycophant), Kinkar (a slave), Dukhi (penurious), Suplya toplya (a basket and fan maker), Kasai (a butcher), Gohattya (a
cow-killer), and K&#257;lebh&#363;t (black devil). Among the territorial sections may be mentioned Sonp&#363;ria, from Sonpur, <a id="d0e8302"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8302">302</a>]</span>and Path&#257;ria, from the hill country. The name Badnagrya is also really territorial, being derived from the town of Badn&#257;gar,
but the members of the section connect it with the <i>bad</i> or banyan tree, the leaves of which they refrain from eating. Two other totemistic gotras are the B&#257;ranga and Baignya, derived
from the <i>b&#257;rang</i> plant (<i>Kydia calycina</i>) and from the brinjal respectively. Some sections have the names of R&#257;jp&#363;t septs, as Chauh&#257;n, Parih&#257;r and Panw&#257;r. This curiously
mixed list of family names appears to indicate that the Bhoyars originate from a small band of R&#257;jp&#363;ts who must have settled
in the District about the fifteenth century as military colonists, and taken their wives from the people of the country. They
may have subsequently been recruited by fresh bands of immigrants who have preserved a slightly higher status. They have abandoned
their old high position, and now rank below the ordinary cultivating castes like Kunbis and Kurmis who arrived later; while
the caste has probably in times past also been recruited to a considerable extent by the admission of families of outsiders.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8313">
<h3>3. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Marriage within the <i>kul</i> or family group is forbidden, as also the union of first cousins. Girls are usually married young, and sometimes infants
of one or two months are given in wedlock, while contracts of betrothal are made for unborn children if they should be of
the proper sex, the mother&#8217;s womb being touched with <i>kunku</i> or red powder to seal the agreement. A small <i>dej</i> or price is usually paid for the bride, amounting to Rs. 5 with 240 lbs. of grain, and 8 seers of <i>gh&#299;</i> and oil. At the betrothal the Joshi or astrologer is consulted to see whether the names of the couple make an auspicious
conjunction. He asks for the names of the bride and bridegroom, and if these are found to be inimical another set of names
is given, and the experiment is continued until a union is obtained which is astrologically auspicious. In order to provide
for this contingency some Bhoyars give their children ten or twelve names at birth. If all the names fail, the Joshi invents
new ones of his own, and in some way brings about the auspicious union to the satisfaction of both parties, who consider it
no business of theirs to pry into the Joshi&#8217;s calculations or to question his methods. After the marriage-shed is erected
<a id="d0e8330"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8330">303</a>]</span>the family god must be invoked to be present at the ceremony. He is asked to come and take his seat in an earthen pot containing
a lighted wick, the pot being supported on a toy chariot made of sticks. A thread is coiled round the neck of the jar, and
the Bhoyars then place it in the middle of the house, confident that the god has entered it, and will ward off all calamities
during the marriage. This is performed by the <i>bh&#257;nwar</i> ceremony, seven earthen pots being placed in a row, while the bride and bridegroom walk round in a circle holding a basket
with a lighted lamp in it. As each circle is completed, one pot is removed. This always takes place at night. The Dholew&#257;rs
do not perform the <i>bh&#257;nwar</i> ceremony, and simply throw sacred rice on the couple, and this is also done in Wardha. Sometimes the Bhoyars dispense with
the presence of the Br&#257;hman and merely get some rice and ju&#257;ri consecrated by him beforehand, which they throw on the heads
of the couple, and thereupon consider the marriage complete. Weddings are generally held in the bright fortnight of Bais&#257;kh
(April-May), and sometimes can be completed in a single day. Widow-marriage is allowed, but it is considered that the widow
should marry a widower and not a bachelor.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8338">
<h3>4. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The regular occupation of the Bhoyars is agriculture, and they are good cultivators, growing much sugar-cane with well-irrigation.
They are industrious, and their holdings on the rocky soils of the plateau Districts are often cleared of stones at the cost
of much labour. Their women work in the fields. In Bet&#363;l they have the reputation of being much addicted to drink.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8343">
<h3>5. Social status.</h3>
<p>They do not now admit outsiders, but their family names show that at one time they probably did so, and this laxity of feeling
survives in the toleration with which they readmit into caste a woman who has gone wrong with an outsider. They eat flesh
and fowls, and the Dholew&#257;rs eat pork, while as already stated they are fond of liquor. To have a shoe thrown on his house
by a caste-fellow is a serious degradation for a Bhoyar, and he must break his earthen pots, clean his house and give a feast.
To be beaten with a shoe by a low caste like Mah&#257;r entails shaving the moustaches and paying a heavy fine, which is spent
on a <a id="d0e8348"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8348">304</a>]</span>feast. The Bhoyars do not take food from any caste but Br&#257;hmans, but no caste higher than Kunbis and M&#257;lis will take water
from them. In social status they rank somewhat below Kunbis. In appearance they are well built, and often of a fair complexion.
Unmarried girls generally wear skirts instead of <i>s&#257;ris</i> or cloths folding between the legs; they also must not wear toe-rings. Women of the Panw&#257;r subcaste wear glass bangles on
the left hand, and brass ones on the right. All women are tattooed. They both burn and bury the dead, placing the corpse on
the pyre with its head to the south or west, and in Wardha to the north. Here they have a peculiar custom as regards mourning,
which is observed only till the next Monday or Thursday whichever falls first. Thus the period of mourning may extend from
one to four days. The Bhoyars are considered in Wardha to be more than ordinarily timid, and also to be considerable simpletons,
while they stand in much awe of Government officials, and consider it a great misfortune to be brought into a court of justice.
Very few of them can read and write.

<h3>1. The tribe and its name.</h3>
<p><b>Bhuiya, Bhuinh&#257;r, Bhumia.</b><a id="d0e8427src" href="#d0e8427" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;The name of a very important tribe of Chota N&#257;gpur, Bengal and Orissa. The Bhuiyas numbered more than 22,000 persons in the
Central Provinces in 1911, being mainly found in the Sarg&#363;ja and Jashpur States. In Bengal and Bih&#257;r the Bhuiyas proper count
about half a million persons, while the M&#363;sahar and Khandait castes, both of whom are mainly derived from the Bhuiyas, total
together well over a million.

</p>
<p>The name Bhuiya means &#8216;Lord of the soil,&#8217; or &#8216;Belonging to the soil,&#8217; and is a Sanskrit derivative. The tribe have completely
forgotten their original name, and adopted this designation conferred on them by the immigrant Aryans. The term Bhuiya, however,
is also employed by other tribes and by some Hindus as a title for landholders, being practically equivalent to zam&#299;nd&#257;r.
And hence a certain confusion arises, and classes or individuals may have the name of Bhuiya without belonging to the tribe
at all. &#8220;In most <a id="d0e8438"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8438">306</a>]</span>parts of Chota N&#257;gpur,&#8221; Sir H. Risley says, &#8220;there is a well-known distinction between a Bhuiya by tribe and a Bhuiya by title.
The Bhuiyas of Bonai and Keonjhar described by Colonel Dalton belong to the former category; the Bhuiya Mundas and Oraons
to the latter. The distinction will be made somewhat clearer if it is explained that every &#8216;tribal Bhuiya&#8217; will as a matter
of course describe himself as Bhuiya, while a member of another tribe will only do so if he is speaking with reference to
a question of land, or desires for some special reason to lay stress on his status as a landholder or agriculturist.&#8221;

</p>
<p>We further find in Bengal and Benares a caste of landholders known as Bhuinh&#257;r or B&#257;bhan, who are generally considered as
a somewhat mixed and inferior group of Br&#257;hman and R&#257;jp&#363;t origin. Both Sir H. Risley and Mr. Crooke adopt this view and deny
any connection between the Bhuinh&#257;rs and the Bhuiya tribes. B&#257;bhan appears to be a corrupt form of Br&#257;hman. Mr. Mazumd&#257;r,
however, states that Bhuiya is never used in Bengali as an equivalent for zam&#299;nd&#257;r or landholder, and he considers that the
Bhuinh&#257;rs and also the B&#257;rah Bhuiyas, a well-known group of twelve landholders of Eastern Bengal and Assam, belonged to the
Bhuiya tribe. He adduces from Sir E. Gait&#8217;s <i>History of Assam</i> the fact that the Chutias and Bhuiyas were dominant in that country prior to its conquest by the Ahoms in the thirteenth
century, and considers that these Chutias gave their name to Chutia or Chota N&#257;gpur. I am unable to express any opinion on
Mr. Mazumd&#257;r&#8217;s argument, and it is also unnecessary as the question does not concern the Central Provinces.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8445">
<h3>2. Distribution of the tribe.</h3>
<p>The principal home of the Bhuiya tribe proper is the south of the Chota N&#257;gpur plateau, comprised in the G&#257;ngpur, Bonai, Keonjhar
and B&#257;mra States. &#8220;The chiefs of these States,&#8221; Colonel Dalton says, &#8220;now call themselves R&#257;jp&#363;ts; if they be so, they are
strangely isolated families of R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The country for the most part belongs to the Bhuiya sub-proprietors. They are a privileged
class, holding as hereditaments the principal offices of the State, and are organised as a body of militia. The chiefs have
no right to exercise any authority till they have received the <i>tilak</i> or <a id="d0e8453"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8453">307</a>]</span>token of investiture from their powerful Bhuiya vassals. Their position altogether renders their claim to be considered R&#257;jp&#363;ts
extremely doubtful, and the stories told to account for their acquisition of the dignity are palpable fables. They were no
doubt all Bhuiyas originally; they certainly do not look like R&#257;jp&#363;ts.&#8221; Members of the tribe are the household servants of
the B&#257;mra R&#257;ja&#8217;s family, and it is said that the first R&#257;ja of B&#257;mra was a child of the Patna house, who was stolen from his
home and anointed king of B&#257;mra by the Bhuiyas and Khonds. Similarly Colonel Dalton records the legend that the Bhuiyas twenty-seven
generations ago stole a child of the Moharbhanj R&#257;ja&#8217;s family, brought it up amongst them and made it their R&#257;ja. He was freely
admitted to intercourse with Bhuiya girls, and the children of this intimacy are the progenitors of the R&#257;jkuli branch of
the tribe. But they are not considered first among Bhuiyas because they are not of pure Bhuiya descent. Again the R&#257;ja of
Keonjhar is always installed by the Bhuiyas. These facts indicate that the Bhuiyas were once the rulers of Chota N&#257;gpur and
are recognised as the oldest inhabitants of the country. From this centre they have spread north through Lohardaga and Haz&#257;rib&#257;gh
and into southern Bih&#257;r, where large numbers of Bhuiyas are encountered on whom the opprobrious designation of M&#363;sahar or
&#8216;rat-eater&#8217; has been conferred by their Hindu neighbours. Others of the tribe who travelled south from Chota N&#257;gpur experienced
more favourable conditions, and here the tendency has been for the Bhuiyas to rise rather than to decline in social status.
&#8220;Some of their leading families,&#8221; Sir H. Risley states, &#8220;have come to be chiefs of the petty States of Orissa, and have now
sunk the Bhuiya in the Khandait or swordsman, a caste of admitted respectability in Orissa and likely in course of time to
transform itself into some variety of R&#257;jp&#363;t.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8455">
<h3>3. Example of the position of the aborigines in Hindu society.</h3>
<p>The varying status of the Bhuiyas in Bih&#257;r, Chota N&#257;gpur and Orissa is a good instance of the different ways in which the
primitive tribes have fared in contact with the immigrant Aryans. Where the country has been completely colonised and populated
by Hindus, as in Bih&#257;r, the aboriginal residents have commonly become transformed into village <a id="d0e8460"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8460">308</a>]</span>drudges, relegated to the meanest occupations, and despised as impure by the Hindu cultivators, like the Cham&#257;rs of northern
India and the Mah&#257;rs of the Mar&#257;tha Districts. Where the Hindu immigration has only been partial and the forests have not
been cleared, as in Chota N&#257;gpur and the Central Provinces, they may keep their old villages and tribal organisation and be
admitted as a body into the hierarchy of caste, ranking above the impure castes but below the Hindu cultivators. This is the
position of the Gonds, Baigas and other tribes in these tracts. While, if the Hindus come only as colonists and not as rulers,
the indigenous residents may retain the overlordship of the soil and the landed proprietors among them may be formed into
a caste ranking with the good cultivating castes of the Aryans. Instances of such are the Khandaits of Orissa, the Binjhw&#257;rs
of Chhatt&#299;sgarh and the Bhil&#257;las of Nim&#257;r and Indore.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8462">
<h3>4. The Bhuiyas a Kolarian tribe.</h3>
<p>The Bhuiyas have now entirely forgotten their own language and speak Hindi, Uriya and Bengali, according as each is the dominant
vernacular of their Hindu neighbours. They cannot therefore on the evidence of language be classified as a Munda or Kolarian
or as a Dravidian tribe. Colonel Dalton was inclined to consider them as Dravidian:<a id="d0e8467src" href="#d0e8467" class="noteref">2</a> &#8220;Mr. Stirling in his account of Orissa classes them among the Kols; but there are no grounds that I know of for so connecting
them. As I have said above, they appear to me to be linked with the Dravidian rather than with the Kolarian tribes.&#8221; His account,
however, does not appear to contain any further evidence in support of this view; and, on the other hand, he identifies the
Bhuiyas with the Savars or Saonrs. Speaking of the Bendkars or Savars of Keonjhar, he says: &#8220;It is difficult to regard them
otherwise than as members of the great Bhuiya family, and thus connecting them we link the Bhuiyas and Savaras and give support
to the conjecture that the former are Dravidian.&#8221; But it is now shown in the <i>Linguistic Survey</i> that the Savars have a Munda dialect. In Chota N&#257;gpur this has been forgotten, and the tribe speak Hindi or Uriya like the
Bhuiyas, but it remains in the hilly tracts of Ganj&#257;m and <a id="d0e8475"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8475">309</a>]</span>Vizagapat&#257;m.<a id="d0e8477src" href="#d0e8477" class="noteref">3</a> Savara is closely related to Kharia and Ju&#257;ng, the dialects of two of the most primitive Munda tribes. The Savars must therefore
be classed as a Munda or Kolarian tribe, and since Colonel Dalton identified the Bhuiyas with the Savars of Chota N&#257;gpur,
his evidence appears really to be in favour of the Kolarian origin of the Bhuiyas. He notes further that the ceremony of naming
children among the Bhuiyas is identical with that of the Mundas and Hos.<a id="d0e8485src" href="#d0e8485" class="noteref">4</a> Mr. Mazumd&#257;r writes: &#8220;Judging from the external appearance and general physical type one would be sure to mistake a Bhuiya
for a Munda. Their habits and customs are essentially Mund&#257;ri. The Bhuiyas who live in and around the District of M&#257;nbh&#363;m
are not much ashamed to admit that they are Kol people; and Bhumia Kol is the name that has been given them there by the Hindus.
The Mundas and Larka-Kols of Chota N&#257;gpur tell us that they first established themselves there by driving out the Bhuiyas;
and it seems likely that the Bhuiyas formed the first batch of the Munda immigrants in Chota N&#257;gpur and became greatly Hinduised
there, and on that account were not recognised by the Mundas as people of their kin.&#8221; If the tradition of the Mundas and Kols
that they came to Chota N&#257;gpur after the Bhuiyas be accepted, and tradition on the point of priority of immigration is often
trustworthy, then it follows that the Bhuiyas must be a Munda tribe. For the main distinction other than that of language
between the Munda and Dravidian tribes is that the former were the earlier and the latter subsequent immigrants. The claim
of the Bhuiyas to be the earliest residents of Chota N&#257;gpur is supported by the fact that they officiate as priests in certain
temples. Because in primitive religion the jurisdiction of the gods is entirely local, and foreigners bringing their own gods
with them are ignorant of the character and qualities of the local deities, with which the indigenous residents are, on the
other hand, well acquainted. Hence the tendency of later comers to employ these latter in the capacity of priests of the godlings
of the earth, corn, forests and hills. Colonel Dalton writes:<a id="d0e8488src" href="#d0e8488" class="noteref">5</a> <a id="d0e8493"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8493">310</a>]</span>&#8220;It is strange that these Hinduised Bhuiyas retain in their own hands the priestly duties of certain old shrines to the exclusion
of Br&#257;hmans. This custom has no doubt descended in Bhuiya families from the time when Br&#257;hmans were not, or had obtained no
footing amongst them, and when the religion of the land and the temples were not Hindu; they are now indeed dedicated to Hindu
deities, but there are evidences of the temples having been originally occupied by other images. At some of these shrines
human sacrifices were offered every third year and this continued till the country came under British rule.&#8221; And again of
the Pauri Bhuiyas of Keonjhar: &#8220;The Pauris dispute with the Ju&#257;ngs the claim to be the first settlers in Keonjhar, and boldly
aver that the country belongs to them. They assert that the R&#257;ja is of their creation and that the prerogative of installing
every new R&#257;ja on his accession is theirs, and theirs alone. The Hindu population of Keonjhar is in excess of the Bhuiya and
it comprises Gonds and Kols, but the claim of the Pauris to the dominion they arrogate is admitted by all; even Br&#257;hmans and
R&#257;jp&#363;ts respectfully acknowledge it, and the former by the addition of Br&#257;hmanical rites to the wild ceremonies of the Bhuiyas
affirm and sanctify their installation.&#8221; In view of this evidence it seems a probable hypothesis that the Bhuiyas are the
earliest residents of these parts of Chota N&#257;gpur and that they are a Kolarian tribe.

<h3>5. The Baigas and the Bhuiyas. Chhatt&#299;sgarh the home of the Baigas.</h3>
<p>There appears to be considerable reason for supposing that the Baiga tribe of the Central Provinces are really a branch of
the Bhuiyas. Though the Baigas are now mainly returned from Mandla and B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t, it seems likely that these Districts were
not their original home, and that they emigrated from Chhatt&#299;sgarh into the Satp&#363;ra hills on the western borders of the plain.
The hill country of Mandla and the Maikal range of B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t form one of the wildest and most inhospitable tracts in the Province,
and it is unlikely that the Baigas would have made their first settlements here and spread thence into the fertile plain of
Chhatt&#299;sgarh. Migration in the opposite direction would be more natural and probable. But it is fairly certain that the Baiga
tribe were among the earliest if not the earliest <a id="d0e8500"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8500">311</a>]</span>residents of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain and the hills north and east of it. The Bhaina, Bhunjia and Binjhw&#257;r tribes who still
reside in this country can all be recognised as offshoots of the Baigas. In the article on Bhaina it is shown that some of
the oldest forts in Bil&#257;spur are attributed to the Bhainas and a chief of this tribe is remembered as having ruled in Bilaigarh
south of the Mah&#257;nadi. They are said to have been dominant in Pendra where they are still most numerous, and to have been
expelled from Phuljhar in Raipur by the Gonds. The Binjhw&#257;rs or Binjh&#257;ls again are an aristocratic subdivision of the Baigas,
belonging to the hills east of Chhatt&#299;sgarh and the Uriya plain country of Sambalpur beyond them. The zam&#299;nd&#257;rs of Bod&#257;s&#257;mar,
R&#257;mpur, Bhatgaon and other estates to the south and east of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain are members of this tribe. Both the Bhainas
and Binjhw&#257;rs are frequently employed as priests of the village deities all over this area, and may therefore be considered
as older residents than the Gond and Kawar tribes and the Hindus. Sir G. Grierson also states that the language of the Baigas
of Mandla and B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t is a form of Chhatt&#299;sgarhi, and this is fairly conclusive evidence of their first having belonged to
Chhatt&#299;sgarh.<a id="d0e8502src" href="#d0e8502" class="noteref">6</a> It seems not unlikely that the Baigas retreated into the hills round Chhatt&#299;sgarh after the Hindu invasion and establishment
of the Haihaya R&#257;jp&#363;t dynasty of Ratanpur, which is now assigned to the ninth century of the Christian era; just as the Gonds
retired from the Nerbudda valley and the N&#257;gpur plain before the Hindus several centuries later. Sir H. Risley states that
the Binjhias or Binjhw&#257;rs of Chota N&#257;gpur say that their ancestors came from Ratanpur twenty generations ago.<a id="d0e8505src" href="#d0e8505" class="noteref">7</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8510">
<h3>6. The Baigas a branch of the Bhuiyas.</h3>
<p>But the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain and the hills north and east of it are adjacent to and belong to the same tract of country as the
Chota N&#257;gpur States, which are the home of the Bhuiyas. Sir H. Risley gives Baiga as a name for a sorcerer, and as a synonym
or title of the Khairw&#257;r tribe in Chota N&#257;gpur, possibly having reference to the idea that <a id="d0e8515"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8515">312</a>]</span>they, being among the original inhabitants of the country, are best qualified to play the part of sorcerer and propitiate
the local gods. It has been suggested in the article on Khairw&#257;r that that tribe are a mongrel offshoot of the Sant&#257;ls and
Cheros, but the point to be noticed here is the use of the term Baiga in Chota N&#257;gpur for a sorcerer; and a sorcerer may be
taken as practically equivalent for a priest of the indigenous deities, all tribes who act in this capacity being considered
as sorcerers by the Hindus. If the Bhuiyas of Chota N&#257;gpur had the title of Baiga, it is possible that it may have been substituted
for the proper tribal name on their migration to the Central Provinces. Mr. Crooke distinguishes two tribes in M&#299;rz&#257;pur whom
he calls the Bhuiyas and Bhuiy&#257;rs. The Bhuiyas of M&#299;rz&#257;pur seem to be clearly a branch of the Bhuiya tribe of Chota N&#257;gpur,
with whom their section-names establish their identity.<a id="d0e8517src" href="#d0e8517" class="noteref">8</a> Mr. Crooke states that the Bhuiyas are distinguished with very great difficulty from the Bhuiy&#257;rs with whom they are doubtless
very closely connected.<a id="d0e8523src" href="#d0e8523" class="noteref">9</a> Of the Bhuiy&#257;rs<a id="d0e8528src" href="#d0e8528" class="noteref">10</a> he writes that the tribe is also known as Baiga, because large numbers of the aboriginal local priests are derived from this
caste. He also states that &#8220;Most Bhuiy&#257;rs are Baigas and officiate in their own as well as allied tribes; in fact, as already
stated, one general name for the tribe is Baiga.&#8221;<a id="d0e8533src" href="#d0e8533" class="noteref">11</a> It seems not unlikely that these Bhuiy&#257;rs are the Baigas of the Central Provinces and that they went to M&#299;rz&#257;pur from here
with the Gonds. Their original name may have been preserved or revived there, while it has dropped out of use in this Province.
The name Baiga in the Central Provinces is sometimes applied to members of other tribes who serve as village priests, and,
as has already been seen, it is used in the same sense in Chota N&#257;gpur. The Baigas of Mandla are also known as Bhumia, which
is only a variant of Bhuiya, having the same meaning of lord of the soil or belonging to the soil. Both Bhuiya and Bhumia
are in fact nearly equivalent to our word &#8216;aboriginal,&#8217; and both are names given to the tribe by the <a id="d0e8538"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8538">313</a>]</span>Hindus and not originally that by which its members called themselves. It would be quite natural that a branch of the Bhuiyas,
who settled in the Central Provinces and were commonly employed as village priests by the Hindus and Gonds should have adopted
the name of the office, Baiga, as their tribal designation; just as the title of Munda or village headman has become the name
of one branch of the Kol tribe, and Bhumij, another term equivalent to Bhuiya, of a second branch. Mr. A. F. Hewitt, Settlement
Officer of Raipur, considered that the Buniyas of that District were the same tribe as the Bhuiyas of the Garhj&#257;t States.<a id="d0e8540src" href="#d0e8540" class="noteref">12</a> By Buniya he must apparently have meant the Bhunjia tribe of Raipur, who as already stated are an offshoot of the Baigas.
Colonel Dalton describes the dances of the Bhuiyas of Chota N&#257;gpur as follows:<a id="d0e8543src" href="#d0e8543" class="noteref">13</a> &#8220;The men have each a wide kind of tambourine. They march round in a circle, beating these and singing a very simple melody
in a minor key on four notes. The women dance opposite to them with their heads covered and bodies much inclined, touching
each other like soldiers in line, but not holding hands or wreathing arms like the Kols.&#8221; This account applies very closely
to the Sela and R&#299;na dances of the Baigas. The Sela dance is danced by men only who similarly march round in a circle, though
they do not carry tambourines in the Central Provinces. Here, however, they sometimes carry sticks and march round in opposite
directions, passing in and out and hitting their sticks against each other as they meet, the movement being exactly like the
grand chain in the Lancers. Similarly the Baiga women dance the R&#299;na dance by themselves, standing close to each other and
bending forward, but not holding each other by the hands and arms, just as described by Colonel Dalton. The Gonds now also
have the Sela and R&#299;na dances, but admit that they are derived from the Baigas. Another point of some importance is that the
Bhuiyas of Chota N&#257;gpur and the Baigas and the tribes derived from them in the Central Provinces have all completely abandoned
their own language and speak a broken form of that of their Hindu neighbours. As has been seen, too, the Bhuiyas are commonly
employed as priests in Chota <a id="d0e8546"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8546">314</a>]</span>N&#257;gpur, and there seems therefore to be a strong case for the original identity of the two tribes.<a id="d0e8548src" href="#d0e8548" class="noteref">14</a> Both the Baigas and Bhuiyas, however, have now become greatly mixed with the surrounding tribes, the Baigas of Mandla and
B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t having a strong Gond element.

<div class="div2" id="d0e8551">
<h3>7. Tribal sub-divisions.</h3>
<p>In Singhbh&#363;m the Bhuiyas call themselves <i>P&#257;wan-bans</i> or &#8216;The Children of the Wind,&#8217; and in connection with Hanum&#257;n&#8217;s title of <i>P&#257;wan-ka-p&#363;t</i> or &#8216;The Son of the Wind,&#8217; are held to be the veritable apes of the R&#257;m&#257;yana who, under the leadership of Hanum&#257;n, the monkey-god,
assisted the Aryan hero R&#257;ma on his expedition to Ceylon. This may be compared with the name given to the Gonds of the Central
Provinces of R&#257;wanbansi, or descendants of R&#257;wan, the idea being that their ancestors were the subjects of R&#257;wan, the demon
king of Ceylon, who was conquered by R&#257;ma. &#8220;All Bhuiyas,&#8221; Sir H. Risley states, &#8220;affect great reverence for the memory of
Rikhmun or Rikhiasan, whom they regard, some as a patron deity, others as a mythical ancestor, whose name distinguishes one
of the divisions of the tribe. It seems probable that in the earliest stage of belief Rikhmun was the bear-totem of a sept
of the tribe, that later on he was transformed into an ancestral hero, and finally promoted to the rank of a tribal god.&#8221;
The Rikhiasan Mahatw&#257;r subtribe of the Bhuiyas in the Central Provinces are named after this hero Rikhmun; the designation
of Mahatw&#257;r signifies that they are the Mahtos or leaders of the Bhuiyas. The Khandaits or P&#257;iks are another subcaste formed
from those who became soldiers; in Orissa they are now, as already stated, a separate caste of fairly high rank. The Parja
or &#8216;subject people&#8217; are the ordinary Bhuiyas, probably those living in Hindu tracts. The Dhur or &#8216;dust&#8217; Gonds, and the Parja
Gonds of Bastar may be noted as a parallel in nomenclature. The Rautadi are a territorial group, taking their name from a
place called Raotal. The Khandaits practise hypergamy with the Rautadi, taking daughters from them, but not giving their daughters
to them. The P&#257;budia or M&#257;dhai are the hill Bhuiyas, and are the <a id="d0e8562"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8562">315</a>]</span>most wild and backward portion of the tribe. Dalton writes of them in Keonjhar: &#8220;They are not bound to fight for the R&#257;ja,
though they occasionally take up arms against him. Their duty is to attend on him and carry his loads when he travels about,
and so long as they are satisfied with his person and his rule, no more willing or devoted subjects could be found. They are
then in Keonjhar, as in Bonai, a race whom you cannot help liking and taking an interest in from the primitive simplicity
of their customs, their amenability and their anxiety to oblige; but unsophisticated as they are they wield an extraordinary
power in Keonjhar, and when they take it into their heads to use that power, the country may be said to be governed by an
oligarchy composed of the sixty chiefs of the Pawri Desh, the Bhuiya Highlands. A knotted string passed from village to village
in the name of the sixty chiefs throws the entire country into commotion, and the order verbally communicated in connection
with it is as implicitly obeyed as if it emanated from the most potent despot.&#8221; This knotted string is known as <i>G&#257;nthi</i>. The P&#257;budias say that their ancestors were twelve brothers belonging to Keonjhar, of whom eight went to an unknown country,
while the remaining four divided among themselves all the territory of which they had knowledge, this being comprised in the
four existing states of Keonjhar, B&#257;mra, Palah&#257;ra and Bonai. Any P&#257;budia who takes up his residence permanently beyond the
boundaries of these four states is considered to lose his caste, like Hindus in former times who went to dwell in the foreign
country beyond the Indus.<a id="d0e8567src" href="#d0e8567" class="noteref">15</a> But if the wandering P&#257;budia returns in two years, and proves that he has not drunk water from any other caste, he is taken
back into the fold. Other subdivisions are the K&#257;ti or Khatti and the B&#257;thudia, these last being an inferior group who are
said to be looked down on because they have taken food from other low castes. No doubt they are really the offspring of irregular
unions.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8570">
<h3>8. Exogamus septs.</h3>
<p>In Raigarh the Bhuiyas appear to have no exogamous divisions. When they wish to arrange a marriage they compare the family
gods of the parties, and if these are not identical and there is no recollection of a common ancestor <a id="d0e8575"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8575">316</a>]</span>for three generations, the union is permitted. In Sambalpur, however, Mr. Mazumd&#257;r states, all Bhuiyas are divided into the
following twelve septs: Th&#257;kur, or the clan of royal blood; Saont, from <i>s&#257;manta</i>, a viceroy; Padh&#257;n, a village headman; N&#257;ik, a military leader; K&#257;lo, a wizard or priest; Dehri, also a priest; Chatria,
one who carried the royal umbrella; S&#257;hu, a moneylender; M&#257;jhi, a headman; Behra, manager of the household; Am&#257;ta, counsellor;
and Dandsena, a police official. The Dehrin sept still worship the village gods on behalf of the tribe.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8580">
<h3>9. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>Marriage is adult, but the more civilised Bhuiyas are gradually adopting Hindu usages, and parents arrange matches for their
children while they are still young. Among the P&#257;budias some primitive customs survive. They have the same system as the Oraons,
by which all the bachelors of the village sleep in one large dormitory; this is known as Dh&#257;ngarb&#257;sa, <i>dh&#257;ngar</i> meaning a farmservant or young man, or M&#257;ndarghar, the house of the drums, because these instruments are kept in it. &#8220;Some
villages,&#8221; Colonel Dalton states, &#8220;have a Dh&#257;ngaria b&#257;sa, or house for maidens, which, strange to say, they are allowed to
occupy without any one to look after them. They appear to have very great liberty, and slips of morality, so long as they
are confined to the tribe, are not much heeded.&#8221; This intimacy between boys and girls of the same village does not, however,
commonly end in marriage, for which a partner should be sought from another village. For this purpose the girls go in a body,
taking with them some ground rice decorated with flowers. They lay this before the elders of the village they have entered,
saying, &#8216;Keep this or throw it into the water, as you prefer.&#8217; The old men pick up the flowers, placing them behind their
ears. In the evening all the boys of the village come and dance with the girls, with intervals for courtship, half the total
number of couples dancing and sitting out alternately. This goes on all night, and in the morning any couples who have come
to an understanding run away together for a day or two. The boy&#8217;s father must present a rupee and a piece of cloth to the
girl&#8217;s mother, and the marriage is considered to be completed.

</p>
<p>Among the P&#257;budia or Madhai Bhuiyas the bride-price <a id="d0e8590"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8590">317</a>]</span>consists of two bullocks or cows, one of which is given to the girl&#8217;s father and the other to her brother. The boy&#8217;s father
makes the proposal for marriage, and the consent of the girl is necessary. At the wedding turmeric and rice are offered to
the sun; some rice is then placed on the girl&#8217;s head and turmeric rubbed on her body, and a brass ring is placed on her finger.
The bridegroom&#8217;s father says to him, &#8220;This girl is ours now: if in future she becomes one-eyed, lame or deaf, she will still
be ours.&#8221; The ceremony concludes with the usual feast and drinking bout. If the boy&#8217;s father cannot afford the bride-price
the couple sometimes run away from home for two or three days, when their parents go in search of them and they are brought
back and married in the boy&#8217;s house.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8592">
<h3>10. Widow-marriage and divorce.</h3>
<p>A widow is often taken by the younger brother of the deceased husband, though no compulsion is exerted over her. But the match
is common because the Bhuiyas have the survival of fraternal polyandry, which consists in allowing unmarried younger brothers
to have access to an elder brother&#8217;s wife during his lifetime.<a id="d0e8597src" href="#d0e8597" class="noteref">16</a> Divorce is allowed for misconduct on the part of the wife or mutual disagreement.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8600">
<h3>11. Religion.</h3>
<p>The Bhuiyas commonly take as their principal deity the spirit of the nearest mountain overlooking their village, and make
offerings to it of butter, rice and fowls. In April they present the first-fruits of the mango harvest. They venerate the
sun as Dharam Deota, but no offerings are made to him. Nearly all Bhuiyas worship the cobra, and some of them call it their
mother and think they are descended from it. They will not touch or kill a cobra, and do not swear by it. In Rairakhol they
venerate a goddess, Rambha Devi, who may be a corn-goddess, as the practice of burning down successive patches of jungle and
sowing seed on each for two or three years is here known as <i>rambha</i>. They think that the sun and moon are sentient beings, and that fire and lightning are the children of the sun, and the stars
the children of the moon. One day the moon invited the sun to dinner and gave him very nice food, so that the sun asked what
it was. The moon said she had cooked her own children, and on this the sun went home and cooked all <a id="d0e8608"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8608">318</a>]</span>his children and ate them, and this is the reason why there are no stars during the day. But his eldest son, fire, went and
hid in a <i>rengal</i> tree, and his daughter, the lightning, darted hither and thither so that the sun could not catch her. And when night came
again, and the stars came out, the sun saw how the moon had deceived him and cursed her, saying that she should die for fifteen
days in every month. And this is the reason for the waxing and waning of the moon. Ever since this event fire has remained
hidden in a <i>rengal</i> tree, and when the Bhuiyas want him they rub two pieces of its wood together and he comes out. This is the Bhuiya explanation
of the production of fire from the friction of wood.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8616">
<h3>12. Religious dancing.</h3>
<p>In the month of K&#257;rtik (October), or the next month, they bring from the forest a branch of the <i>karm</i> tree and venerate it and perform the <i>karma</i> dance in front of it. They think that this worship and dance will cause the <i>karma</i> tree, the mango, the jack-fruit and the mahua to bear a full crop of fruit. Monday, Wednesday and Friday are considered the
proper days for worshipping the deities, and children are often named on a Friday.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8630">
<h3>13. Funeral rites and inheritance.</h3>
<p>The dead are either buried or burnt, the corpse being placed always with the feet pointing to its native village. On the tenth
day the soul of the dead person is called back to the house. But if a man is killed by a tiger or by falling from a tree no
mourning is observed for him, and his soul is not brought back. To perish from snake-bite is considered a natural death, and
in such cases the usual obsequies are awarded. This is probably because they revere the cobra as their first mother. The P&#257;budia
Bhuiyas throw four to eight annas&#8217; worth of copper on to the pyre or into the grave, and if the deceased had a cow some <i>gh&#299;</i> or melted butter. No division of property can take place during the lifetime of either parent, but when both have died the
children divide the inheritance, the eldest son taking two shares and the others one equal share each.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8638">
<h3>14. Physical appearance and occupation.</h3>
<p>Colonel Dalton describes the Bhuiyas as, &#8220;A dark-brown, well-proportioned race, with black, straight hair, plentiful on the
head, but scant on the face, of middle height, figures well knit and capable of enduring great fatigue, but <a id="d0e8643"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8643">319</a>]</span>light-framed like the Hindu rather than presenting the usual muscular development of the hillman.&#8221; Their dress is scanty,
and in the Tributary States Dalton says that the men and women all wear dresses of brown cotton cloth. This may be because
white is a very conspicuous colour in the forests. They wear ornaments and beads, and are distinctive in that neither men
nor women practise tattooing, though in some localities this rule is not observed by the women. To keep themselves warm at
night they kindle two fires and sleep between them, and this custom has given rise to the saying, &#8216;Wherever you see a Bhuiya
he always has a fire.&#8217; In B&#257;mra the Bhuiyas still practise shifting cultivation, for which they burn the forest growth from
the hillsides and sow oilseeds in the fresh soil. This method of agriculture is called locally Khasrathumi. They obtain their
lands free from the R&#257;ja in return for acting as luggage porters and coolies. In B&#257;mra they will not serve as farm-servants
or labourers for hire, but elsewhere they are more docile.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8645">
<h3>15. Social customs.</h3>
<p>A woman divorced for adultery is not again admitted to caste intercourse. Her parents take her to their village, where she
has to live in a separate hut and earn her own livelihood. If any Bhuiya steals from a Kol, G&#257;nda or Ghasia he is permanently
put out of caste, while for killing a cow the period of expulsion is twelve years. The emblem of the Bhuiyas is a sword, in
reference to their employment as soldiers, and this they affix to documents in place of their signature.

</span><h2>Bhulia</h2>
<p><b>Bhulia,<a id="d0e8656src" href="#d0e8656" class="noteref">1</a> Bholia, Bhoriya, Bholwa, Mihir, Mehar.</b>&#8212;A caste of weavers in the Uriya country. In 1901 the Bhulias numbered 26,000 persons, but with the transfer of Sambalpur
and the Uriya States to Bengal this figure has been reduced to 5000. A curious fact about the caste is that though solely
domiciled in the Uriya territories, many families belonging to it talk Hindi in their own houses. According to one of their
traditions they immigrated to this part of the country with the first Chauh&#257;n R&#257;ja of Patna, and it may be that they are members
of some <a id="d0e8660"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8660">320</a>]</span>northern caste who have forgotten their origin and taken to a fresh calling in the land of their adoption. The Koshtas of
Chhatt&#299;sgarh have a subcaste called Bhoriya, and possibly the Bhulias have some connection with these. The caste sometimes
call themselves Dev&#257;ng, and Dev&#257;ng or Dev&#257;ngan is the name of another subcaste of Koshtis. Various local derivations of the
name are current, generally connecting it with <i>bh&#363;lna</i>, to forget. The Bhulias occupy a higher rank than the ordinary weavers, corresponding with that of the Koshtis elsewhere,
and this is to some extent considered to be an unwarranted pretension. Thus one saying has it: &#8220;Formerly a son was born from
a Chand&#257;l woman; at that time none were aware of his descent or rank, and so he was called Bhulia (one who is forgotten).
He took the loom in his hands and became the brother-in-law of the G&#257;nda.&#8221; The object here is obviously to relegate the Bhulia
to the same impure status as the G&#257;nda. Again the Bhulias affect the honorific title of Meher, and another saying addresses
them thus: &#8220;Why do you call yourself Meher? You make a hole in the ground and put your legs into it and are like a cow with
foot-and-mouth disease struggling in the mud.&#8221; The allusion here is to the habit of the weaver of hollowing out a hole for
his feet as he sits before the loom, while cattle with foot-and-mouth disease are made to stand in mud to cool and cleanse
the feet.

</p>
<p>The caste have no subcastes, except that in K&#257;l&#257;handi a degraded section is recognised who are called S&#257;np&#257;ra Bhulias, and
with whom the others refuse to intermarry. These are, there is little reason to doubt, the progeny of illicit unions. They
say that they have two <i>gotras</i>, N&#257;gas from the cobra and Kachhap from the tortoise. But these have only been adopted for the sake of respectability, and
exercise no influence on marriage, which is regulated by a number of exogamous groups called <i>vansa</i>. The names of the <i>vansas</i> are usually either derived from villages or are titles or nicknames. Two of them, B&#257;gh (tiger) and Kimir (crocodile), are
totemistic, while two more, Kumh&#257;r (potter) and Dhuba (washerman), are the names of other castes. Examples of titular names
are B&#257;nkra (crooked), <a id="d0e8676"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8676">321</a>]</span>Ranj&#363;jha (warrior), Kodjit (one who has conquered a score of people) and others. The territorial names are derived from those
of villages where the caste reside at present. Marriage within the <i>vansa</i> is forbidden, but some of the <i>vansas</i> have been divided into <i>bad</i> and <i>s&#257;n</i>, or great and small, and members of these may marry with each other, the subdivision having been adopted when the original
group became so large as to include persons who were practically not relations. The binding portion of the wedding ceremony
is that the bridegroom should carry the bride in a basket seven times round the <i>hom</i> or sacrificial fire. If he cannot do this, the girl&#8217;s grandfather carries them both. After the ceremony the pair return to
the bridegroom&#8217;s village, and are made to sleep on the same bed, some elder woman of the family lying between them. After
a few days the girl goes back to her parents and does not rejoin her husband until she attains maturity. The remarriage of
widows is permitted, and in Native States is not less costly to the bridegroom than the regular ceremony. In Sonpur the suitor
must proceed to the R&#257;ja and pay him twenty rupees for his permission, which is given in the shape of a present of rice and
nuts. Similar sums are paid to the caste-fellows and the parents of the girl, and the R&#257;ja&#8217;s rice and nuts are then placed
on the heads of the couple, who become man and wife. Divorce may be effected at the instance of the husband or the wife&#8217;s
parents on the mere ground of incompatibility of temper. The position of the caste corresponds to that of the Koshtas; that
is, they rank below the good cultivating castes, but above the menial and servile classes. They eat fowls and the flesh of
wild pig, and drink liquor. A <i>liaison</i> with one of the impure castes is the only offence entailing permanent expulsion from social intercourse. A curious rule is
that in the case of a woman going wrong with a man of the caste, the man only is temporarily outcasted and forced to pay a
fine on readmission, while the woman escapes without penalty. They employ Br&#257;hmans for ceremonial purposes. They are considered
proverbially stupid, like the Koris in the northern Districts, but very laborious. One saying about them is: &#8220;The Kewat catches
fish but himself eats crabs, <a id="d0e8696"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8696">322</a>]</span>and the Bhulia weaves loin-cloths but himself wears only a rag&#8221;; and another: &#8220;A Bhulia who is idle is as useless as a confectioner&#8217;s
son who eats sweetmeats, or a moneylender&#8217;s son with a generous disposition, or a cultivator&#8217;s son who is extravagant.&#8221;

</span><h2>Bhunjia</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8701">
<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Bhunjia.<a id="d0e8707src" href="#d0e8707" class="noteref">1</a></b>&#8212;A small Dravidian tribe residing in the Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh and Khari&#257;r zam&#299;nd&#257;ris of the Raipur District, and numbering about
7000 persons. The tribe was not returned outside this area in 1911, but Sherring mentions them in a list of the hill tribes
of the Jaipur zam&#299;nd&#257;ri of Vizagapatam, which touches the extreme south of Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh. The Bhunjias are divided into two
branches, Chaukhutia and Chinda, and the former have the following legend of their origin. On one occasion a Bhatra Gond named
B&#257;char cast a net into the Pairi river and brought out a stone. He threw the stone back into the river and cast his net again,
but a second and yet a third time the stone came out. So he laid the stone on the bank of the river and went back to his house,
and that night he dreamt that the stone was Bura Deo, the great God of the Gonds. So he said: &#8216;If this dream be true let me
draw in a deer in my net to-morrow for a sign&#8217;; and the next day the body of a deer appeared in his net. The stone then called
upon the Gond to worship him as Bura Deo, but the Gond demurred to doing so himself, and said he would provide a substitute
as a devotee. To this Bura Deo agreed, but said that B&#257;char, the Gond, must marry his daughter to the substituted worshipper.
The Gond then set out to search for somebody, and in the village of Lafandi he found a Halba of the name of Konda, who was
a cripple, deaf and dumb, blind, and a leper. He brought Konda to the stone, and on reaching it he was miraculously cured
of all his ailments and gladly began to worship Bura Deo. He afterwards married the Gond&#8217;s daughter and they had a son called
Chaukhutia Bhunjia, who was the ancestor of the Chaukhutia division of the tribe. Now the term Chaukhutia in <a id="d0e8710"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8710">323</a>]</span>Chhatt&#299;sgarhi signifies a bastard, and the story related above is obviously intended to signify that the Chaukhutia Bhunjias
are of mixed descent from the Gonds and Halbas. It is clearly with this end in view that the Gond is made to decline to worship
the stone himself and promise to find a substitute, an incident which is wholly unnatural and is simply dragged in to meet
the case. The Chaukhutia subtribe especially worship Bura Deo, and sing a song relating to the finding of the stone in their
marriage ceremony as follows:

</div>
</div>
<p>The song refers to the incidents in the story. Th&#257;kur Deo is the title given to the divine stone, Konda is the Halba priest,
and B&#257;char the Gond who cast the net. B&#363;dha R&#257;ja, otherwise Singh Sei, is the Chief who was ruling in Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh at the
time, Lafandi the village where Konda Halba was found, and the &#256;nand M&#257;ti or Happy Spot is that where the stone was taken
out of the river. The majority of the sept-names returned are of Gond origin, and there seems no doubt that the Chaukhutias
are, as the story says, of mixed descent from the Halbas and Gonds. It is <a id="d0e8758"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8758">324</a>]</span>noticeable, however, that the Bhunjias, though surrounded by Gonds on all sides, do not speak Gondi but a dialect of Hindi,
which Sir G. Grierson considers to resemble that of the Halbas, and also describes as &#8220;A form of Chhatt&#299;sgarhi which is practically
the same as Baig&#257;ni. It is a jargon spoken by Binjhw&#257;rs, Bhumias and Bhunjias of Raipur, Raigarh, S&#257;rangarh and Patna in the
Central Provinces.&#8221;<a id="d0e8760src" href="#d0e8760" class="noteref">2</a> The Binjhw&#257;rs also belong to the country of the Bhunjias, and one or two estates close to Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh are held by members
of this tribe. The Chinda division of the Bhunjias have a saying about themselves: &#8216;<i>Chinda R&#257;ja, Bhunjia P&#257;ik&#8217;</i>; and they say that there was originally a Kam&#257;r ruler of Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh who was dispossessed by Chinda. The Kam&#257;rs are a
small and very primitive tribe of the same locality. <i>P&#257;ik</i> means a foot-soldier, and it seems therefore that the Bhunjias formed the levies of this Chinda, who may very probably have
been one of themselves. The term Bhunjia may perhaps signify one who lives on the soil, from <i>bh&#363;m</i>, the earth, and <i>jia</i>, dependent on. The word <i>Birjia</i>, a synonym for Binjhw&#257;r, is similarly a corruption of <i>bewar jia</i>, and means one who is dependent on <i>dahia</i> or patch cultivation. Sir H. Risley gives Birjia, Binjhia and Binjhw&#257;r<a id="d0e8787src" href="#d0e8787" class="noteref">3</a> as synonymous terms, and Bhunjia may be another corruption of the same sort. The Binjhw&#257;rs are a Hinduised offshoot of the
ancient Baiga tribe, who may probably have been in possession of the hills bordering the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain as well as of
the Satp&#363;ra range before the advent of the Gonds, as the term Baiga is employed for a village priest over a large part of
this area. It thus seems not improbable that the Chinda Bhunjias may have been derived from the Binjhw&#257;rs, and this would
account for the fact that the tribe speaks a dialect of Hindi and not Gondi. As already seen, the Chaukhutia subcaste appear
to be of mixed origin from the Gonds and Halbas, and as the Chindas are probably descended from the Baigas, the Bhunjias may
be considered to be an offshoot from these three important tribes.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8792">
<h3>2. Subdivisions.</h3>
<p>Of the two subtribes already mentioned the Chaukhutia <a id="d0e8797"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8797">325</a>]</span>are recognised to be of illegitimate descent. As a consequence of this they strive to obtain increased social estimation by
a ridiculously strict observance of the rules of ceremonial purity. If any man not of his own caste touches the hut where
a Chaukhutia cooks his food, it is entirely abandoned and a fresh one built. At the time of the census they threatened to
kill the enumerator if he touched their huts to affix the census number. Pegs had therefore to be planted in the ground a
little in front of the huts and marked with their numbers. The Chaukhutia will not eat food cooked by other members of his
own community, and this is a restriction found only among those of bastard descent, where every man is suspicious of his neighbour&#8217;s
parentage. He will not take food from the hands of his own daughter after she is married; as soon as the ceremony is over
her belongings are at once removed from the hut, and even the floor beneath the seat of the bride and bridegroom during the
marriage ceremony is dug up and the surface earth thrown away to avoid any risk of defilement. Only when it is remembered
that these rules are observed by people who do not wash themselves from one week&#8217;s end to the other, and wear the same wisp
of cloth about their loins until it comes to pieces, can the full absurdity of such customs as the above be appreciated. But
the tendency appears to be of the same kind as the intense desire for respectability so often noticed among the lower classes
in England. The Chindas, whose pedigree is more reliable, are far less particular about their social purity.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8799">
<h3>3. Marriage.</h3>
<p>As already stated, the exogamous divisions of the Bhunjias are derived from those of the Gonds. Among the Chaukhutias it is
considered a great sin if the signs of puberty appear in a girl before she is married, and to avoid this, if no husband has
been found for her, they perform a &#8216;K&#257;nd By&#257;h&#8217; or &#8216;Arrow Marriage&#8217;: the girl walks seven times round an arrow fixed in the
ground, and is given away without ceremony to the man who by previous arrangement has brought the arrow. If a girl of the
Chinda group goes wrong with an outsider before marriage and becomes pregnant, the matter is hushed up, but if she is a Chaukhutia
it is said that she is finally expelled from the community, <a id="d0e8804"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8804">326</a>]</span>the same severe course being adopted even when she is not pregnant if there is reason to suppose that the offence has been
committed. A proposal for marriage among the Chaukhutias is made on the boy&#8217;s behalf by two men who are known as Mah&#257;lia and
Jang&#257;lia, and are supposed to represent a Nai (barber) and Dh&#299;mar (water-carrier), though they do not actually belong to these
castes. As among the Gonds, the marriage takes place at the bridegroom&#8217;s village, and the Mah&#257;lia and Jang&#257;lia act as stewards
of the ceremony, and are entrusted with the rice, pulse, salt, oil and other provisions, the bridegroom&#8217;s family having no
function in the matter except to pay for them. The provisions are all stored in a separate hut, and when the time for the
feast has come they are distributed raw to all the guests, each family of whom cook for themselves. The reason for this is,
as already explained, that each one is afraid of losing status by eating with other members of the tribe. The marriage is
solemnised by walking round the sacred post, and the ceremony is conducted by a hereditary priest known as D&#299;nw&#257;ri, a member
of the tribe, whose line it is believed will never become extinct. Among the Chinda Bhunjias the bride goes away with her
husband, and in a short time returns with him to her parents&#8217; house for a few days, to make an offering to the deities. But
the Chaukhutias will not allow her, after she has lived in her father-in-law&#8217;s house, to return to her home. In future if
she goes to visit her parents she must stay outside the house and cook her food separately. Widow-marriage and divorce are
permitted, but a husband will often overlook transgressions on the part of his wife and only put her away when her conduct
has become an open scandal. In such a case he will either quietly leave house and wife and settle alone in another village,
or have his wife informed by means of a neighbour that if she does not leave the village he will do so. It is not the custom
to bring cases before the tribal committee or to claim damages. A special tie exists between a man and his sister&#8217;s children.
The marriage of a brother&#8217;s son or daughter to a sister&#8217;s daughter or son is considered the most suitable. A man will not
allow his sister&#8217;s children to eat the leavings of food on his plate, <a id="d0e8806"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8806">327</a>]</span>though his own children may do so. This is a special token of respect to his sister&#8217;s children. He will not chastise his sister&#8217;s
children, even though they deserve it. And it is considered especially meritorious for a man to pay for the wedding ceremony
of his sister&#8217;s son or daughter.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8808">
<h3>4. Religion.</h3>
<p>Every third year in the month of Chait (March) the tribe offer a goat and a cocoanut to M&#257;ta, the deity of cholera and smallpox.
They bow daily to the sun with folded hands, and believe that he is of special assistance to them in the liquidation of debt,
which the Bhunjias consider a primary obligation. When a debt has been paid off they offer a cocoanut to the sun as a mark
of gratitude for his assistance. They also pay great reverence to the tortoise. They call the tortoise the footstool (<i>p&#299;dha</i>) of God, and have adopted the Hindu theory that the earth is supported by a tortoise swimming in the midst of the ocean.
Professor Tylor explains as follows how this belief arose:<a id="d0e8816src" href="#d0e8816" class="noteref">4</a> &#8220;To man in the lower levels of science the earth is a flat plain over which the sky is placed like a dome as the arched upper
shell of the tortoise stands upon the flat plate below, and this is why the tortoise is the symbol or representative of the
world.&#8221; It is said that Bhunjia women are never allowed to sit either on a footstool or a bed-cot, because these are considered
to be the seats of the deities. They consider it disrespectful to walk across the shadow of any elderly person, or to step
over the body of any human being or revered object on the ground. If they do this inadvertently, they apologise to the person
or thing. If a man falls from a tree he will offer a chicken to the tree-spirit.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8821">
<h3>5. Social rules.</h3>
<p>The tribe will eat pork, but abstain from beef and the flesh of monkeys. Notwithstanding their strictness of social observance,
they rank lower than the Gonds, and only the Kam&#257;rs will accept food from their hands. A man who has got maggots in a wound
is purified by being given to drink water, mixed with powdered turmeric, in which silver and copper rings have been dipped.
Women are secluded during the menstrual period for as long as eight days, and during this time they may not enter the dwelling-hut
nor touch any article belonging to it. The Bhunjias take their <a id="d0e8826"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8826">328</a>]</span>food on plates of leaves, and often a whole family will have only one brass vessel, which will be reserved for production
on the visit of a guest. But no strangers can be admitted to the house, and a separate hut is kept in the village for their
use. Here they are given uncooked grain and pulse, which they prepare for themselves. When the women go out to work they do
not leave their babies in the house, but carry them tied up in a small rag under the arm. They have no knowledge of medicine
and are too timid to enter a Government dispensary. Their panacea for most diseases is branding the skin with a hot iron,
which is employed indifferently for headache, pains in the stomach and rheumatism. Mr. Py&#257;re L&#257;l notes that one of his informants
had recently been branded for rheumatism on both knees and said that he felt much relief.

<h3>1. Origin and tradition.</h3>
<p><b>Binjhw&#257;r, Binjh&#257;l.</b><a id="d0e8886src" href="#d0e8886" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A comparatively civilised Dravidian tribe, or caste formed from a tribe, found in the Raipur and Bil&#257;spur Districts and the
adjoining Uriya country. In 1911 the Binjhw&#257;rs numbered 60,000 persons in the Central Provinces. There is little or no doubt
that the Binjhw&#257;rs are an offshoot of the primitive Baiga tribe of Mandla and B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t, who occupy the Satp&#363;ra or Maikal hills
to the north of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain. In these Districts a Binjhw&#257;r subdivision of the Baigas exists; it is the most civilised
and occupies the highest rank in the tribe. In Bhand&#257;ra is found the Injhw&#257;r caste who are boatmen and cultivators. This caste
is derived from the Binjhw&#257;r subdivision of the Baigas, and the name Injhw&#257;r is simply a corruption of Binjhw&#257;r. Neither the
Binjhw&#257;rs nor the Baigas are found except in the territories above mentioned, and it seems clear that the Binjhw&#257;rs are a
comparatively civilised section of the Baigas, who have become a distinct caste. They are in fact the landholding section
of the Baigas, like the R&#257;j-Gonds among the Gonds and the Bhil&#257;las among Bh&#299;ls. The zam&#299;nd&#257;rs of Bod&#257;s&#257;mar, R&#257;mpur, Bhatg&#257;on
and other estates to the south and east of the Chhattlsgarh plain belong to this tribe. But owing <a id="d0e8889"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8889">330</a>]</span>to the change of name their connection with the parent Baigas has now been forgotten. The name Binjhw&#257;r is derived from the
Vindhya hills, and the tribe still worship the goddess Vindhyab&#257;sini of these hills as their tutelary deity. They say that
their ancestors migrated from Binjhakop to L&#257;mpa, which may be either L&#257;mta in B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t or L&#257;ph&#257;garh in Bil&#257;spur. The hills
of Mandla, the home of perhaps the most primitive Baigas, are quite close to the Vindhya range. The tribe say that their original
ancestors were <i>B&#257;rah bhai betk&#257;r</i>, or the twelve Brother Archers. They were the sons of the goddess Vindhyab&#257;sini. One day they were out shooting and let off
their arrows, which flew to the door of the great temple at Puri and stuck in it. Nobody in the place was able to pull them
out, not even when the king&#8217;s elephants were brought and harnessed to them; till at length the brothers arrived and drew them
forth quite easily with their hands, and the king was so pleased with their feat that he gave them the several estates which
their descendants now hold. The story recalls that of Arthur and the magic sword. According to another legend the mother of
the first R&#257;ja of Patna, a Chauh&#257;n R&#257;jp&#363;t, had fled from northern India to Sambalpur after her husband and relations had been
killed in battle. She took refuge in a Binjhw&#257;r&#8217;s hut and bore a son who became R&#257;ja of Patna; and in reward for the protection
afforded to his mother he gave the Binjhw&#257;r the Bod&#257;s&#257;mar estate, requiring only of him and his descendants the tribute of
a silk cloth on accession to the zam&#299;nd&#257;ri; and this has been rendered ever since by the zam&#299;nd&#257;rs of Bod&#257;s&#257;mar to the R&#257;jas
of Patna as a mark of fealty. It is further stated that the twelve archers when they fired the memorable arrows in the forest
were in pursuit of a wild boar; and the landholding class of Binjhw&#257;rs are called B&#257;riha from <i>b&#257;r&#257;h</i>, a boar. As is only fitting, the Binjhw&#257;rs have taken the arrow as their tribal symbol or mark; their cattle are branded
with it, and illiterate Binjhw&#257;rs sign it in place of their name. If a husband cannot be found for a girl she is sometimes
married to an arrow. At a Binjhw&#257;r wedding an arrow is laid on the trunk of mahua<a id="d0e8897src" href="#d0e8897" class="noteref">2</a> which forms the <a id="d0e8902"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8902">331</a>]</span>marriage-post, and honours are paid to it as representing the bridegroom.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8904">
<h3>2. Tribal subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The tribe have four subdivisions, the Binjhw&#257;rs proper, the Sonjharas, the Birjhias and the Binjhias. The Sonjharas consist
of those who took to washing for gold in the sands of the Mah&#257;nadi, and it may be noted that a separate caste of Sonjharas
is also in existence in this locality besides the Binjhw&#257;r group. The Birjhias are those who practised <i>bewar</i> or shifting cultivation in the forests, the name being derived from <i>bewarjia</i>, one living by <i>bewar</i>-sowing. Binjhia is simply a diminutive form of Binjhw&#257;r, but in Bil&#257;spur it is sometimes regarded as a separate caste. The
zam&#299;nd&#257;r of Bhatgaon belongs to this group. The tribe have also exogamous divisions, the names of which are of a diverse character,
and on being scrutinised show a mixture of foreign blood. Among totemistic names are B&#257;gh, a tiger; Pod, a buffalo; Kamalia,
the lotus flower; Pankn&#257;li, the water-crow; T&#257;r, the date-palm; J&#257;l, a net, and others. Some of the sections are nicknames,
as Udh&#257;r, a debtor; Marai Meli B&#257;gh, one who carried a dead tiger; Ultum, a talker; J&#257;lia, a liar; Kessal, one who has shaved
a man, and so on. Several are the names of other castes, as Loh&#257;r, D&#363;dh Kawaria, Bh&#299;l, B&#257;nka and M&#257;jhi, indicating that members
of these castes have become Binjhw&#257;rs and have founded families. The sept names also differ in different localities; the Birjhia
subtribe who live in the same country as the Mundas have several Munda names among their septs, as Munna, Son, Solai; while
the Binjhw&#257;rs who are neighbours of the Gonds have Gond sept names, as Tek&#257;m, Sonw&#257;ni, and others. This indicates that there
has been a considerable amount of intermarriage with the surrounding tribes, as is the case generally among the lower classes
of the population in Chhatt&#299;sgarh. Even now if a woman of any caste from whom the Binjhw&#257;rs will take water to drink forms
a connection with a man of the tribe, though she herself must remain in an irregular position, her children will be considered
as full members of it. The B&#257;rhias or landowning group have now adopted names of Sanskrit formation, as Gajendra, an elephant,
R&#257;meswar, the god R&#257;ma, and N&#257;geshwar, the cobra deity. Two of their septs are named Loh&#257;r (blacksmith) <a id="d0e8918"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8918">332</a>]</span>and Kumh&#257;r (potter), and may be derived from members of these castes who became Binjhw&#257;rs or from Binjhw&#257;rs who took up the
occupations. At a Binjhw&#257;r wedding the presence of a person belonging to each of the Loh&#257;r and Kumh&#257;r septs is essential,
the reason being probably the estimation in which the two handicrafts were held when the Binjhw&#257;rs first learnt them from
their Hindu neighbours.

<h3>3. Marriage.</h3>
<p>In Sambalpur there appears to be no system of exogamous groups, and marriage is determined simply by relationship. The union
of agnates is avoided as long as the connection can be traced between them, but on the mother&#8217;s side all except first cousins
may marry. Marriage is usually adult, and girls are sometimes allowed to choose their own husbands. A bride-price of about
eight <i>khandis</i> (1400 lbs.) of unhusked rice is paid. The ceremony is performed at the bridegroom&#8217;s house, to which the bride proceeds after
bidding farewell to her family and friends in a fit of weeping. Weddings are avoided during the four months of the rainy season,
and in Chait (March) because it is inauspicious, Jeth (May) because it is too hot, and P&#363;s (December) because it is the last
month of the year among the Binjhw&#257;rs. The marriage ceremony should begin on a Sunday, when the guests are welcomed and their
feet washed. On Monday the formal reception of the bride takes place, the Gands&#257;n or scenting ceremony follows on Tuesday,
and on Wednesday is the actual wedding. At the scenting ceremony seven married girls dressed in new clothes dyed yellow with
turmeric conduct the bridegroom round the central post; one holds a dish containing rice, mango leaves, myrobalans and betel-nuts,
and a second sprinkles water from a small pot. At each round the bridegroom is made to throw some of the condiments from the
dish on to the wedding-post, and after the seven rounds he is seated and is rubbed with oil and turmeric.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8928">
<h3>4. The marriage ceremony.</h3>
<p>Among the Birjhias a trunk of mahua with two branches is erected in the marriage-shed, and on this a dagger is placed in a
winnowing-fan filled with rice, the former representing the bridegroom and the latter the bride. The bride first goes round
the post seven times alone, and then the bridegroom, and after this they go round it together. A <a id="d0e8933"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8933">333</a>]</span>plough is brought and they stand upon the yoke, and seven cups of water having been collected from seven different houses,
four are poured over the bridegroom and three over the bride. Some men climb on to the top of the shed and pour pots of water
down on to the couple. This is now said to be done only as a joke. Next morning two strong men take the bridegroom and bride,
who are usually grown up, on their backs, and the parties pelt each other with unhusked rice. Then the bridegroom holds the
bride in his arms from behind and they stand facing the sun, while some old man ties round their feet a thread specially spun
by a virgin. The couple stand for some time and then fall to the ground as if dazzled by his rays, when water is again poured
over their bodies to revive them. Lastly, an old man takes the arrow from the top of the marriage-post and draws three lines
with it on the ground to represent the Hindu trinity, Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, and the bridegroom jumps over these holding
the bride in his arms. The couple go to bathe in a river or tank, and on the way home the bridegroom shoots seven arrows at
an image of a s&#257;mbhar deer made with straw. At the seventh shot the bride&#8217;s brother takes the arrow, and running away and
hiding it in his cloth lies down at the entrance of the bridegroom&#8217;s house. The couple go up to him, and the bridegroom examines
his body with suspicion, pretending to think that he is dead. He draws the arrow out of his cloth and points to some blood
which has been previously sprinkled on the ground. After a time the boy gets up and receives some liquor as a reward. This
procedure may perhaps be a symbolic survival of marriage by capture, the bridegroom killing the bride&#8217;s brother before carrying
her off, or more probably, perhaps, the boy may represent a dead deer. In some of the wilder tracts the man actually waylays
and seizes the girl before the wedding, the occasion being previously determined, and the women of her family trying to prevent
him. If he succeeds in carrying her off they stay for three or four days in the forest and then return and are married.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8935">
<h3>5. Sexual morality.</h3>
<p>If a Binjhw&#257;r girl is seduced and rendered pregnant by a man of the tribe, the people exact a feast and compel them to join
their hands in an informal manner before the <a id="d0e8940"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8940">334</a>]</span>caste committee, the tie thus formed being considered as indissoluble as a formal marriage. Polygamy is permitted; a Binjhw&#257;r
zam&#299;nd&#257;r marries a new wife, who is known as P&#257;t R&#257;ni, to celebrate his accession to his estates, even though he may have
five or six already.

</p>
<p>Divorce is recognised but is not very common, and a married woman having an intrigue with another Binjhw&#257;r is often simply
made over to him and they live as husband and wife. If this man does not wish to take her she can live with any other, conjugal
morality being very loose in Sambalpur. In Bod&#257;s&#257;mar a fine of from one to ten rupees is payable to the zam&#299;nd&#257;r in the case
of each divorce, and a feast must also be given to the caste-fellows.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8944">
<h3>6. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
<p>The tribe usually bury the dead, and on the third day they place on the grave some uncooked rice and a lighted lamp. As soon
as an insect flies to the lamp they catch it, and placing it in a cake of flour carry this to a stream, where it is worshipped
with an offering of coloured rice. It is then thrust into the sand or mud in the bed of the stream with a grass broom. This
ceremony is called Kh&#257;rp&#257;ni or &#8216;Grass and Water,&#8217; and appears to be a method of disposing of the dead man&#8217;s spirit. It is
not performed at all for young children, while, on the other hand, in the case of respected elders a second ceremony is carried
out of the same nature, being known as Bad&#257;p&#257;ni or &#8216;Great Water.&#8217; On this occasion the <i lang="und">j&#299;va</i> or soul is worshipped with greater pomp. Except in the case of wicked souls, who are supposed to become malignant ghosts,
the Binjhw&#257;rs do not seem to have any definite belief in a future life. They say, &#8216;<i lang="und">Je maris te saris</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;That which is dead is rotten and gone.&#8217;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8955">
<h3>7. Religion.</h3>
<p>The tribe worship the common village deities of Chhatt&#299;sgarh, and extend their veneration to Bura Deo, the principal god of
the Gonds. They venerate their daggers, spears and arrows on the day of Dasahra, and every third year their tutelary goddess
Vindhyab&#257;sini is carried in procession from village to village. Mr. Mi&#257;n Bhai gives the following list of precepts as forming
the Binjhw&#257;r&#8217;s moral code:&#8212;Not to commit adultery outside the caste; not to eat beef; not to murder; not to steal; not to
swear falsely before the caste committee. The tribe have <i>gurus</i> or <a id="d0e8963"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8963">335</a>]</span>spiritual preceptors, whom he describes as the most ignorant Bair&#257;gis, very little better than impostors. When a boy or girl
grows up the Bair&#257;gi comes and whispers the <i>Karn mantra</i> or spell in his ear, also hanging a necklace of <i>tulsi</i> (basil) beads round his neck; for this the <i>guru</i> receives a cloth, a cocoanut and a cash payment of four annas to a rupee. Thereafter he visits his disciples annually at
harvest time and receives a present of grain from them.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8974">
<h3>8. Festivals.</h3>
<p>On the 11th of Bh&#257;don (August) the tribe celebrate the <i>karma</i> festival, which is something like May-Day or a harvest feast. The youths and maidens go to the forest and bring home a young
<i>karma</i> tree, singing, dancing and beating drums. Offerings are made to the tree, and then the whole village, young and old, drink
and dance round it all through the night. Next morning the tree is taken to the nearest stream or tank and consigned to it.
After this the young girls of five or six villages make up a party and go about to the different villages accompanied by drummers
and G&#257;nda musicians. They are entertained for the night, and next morning dance for five or six hours in the village and then
go on to another.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e8985">
<h3>9. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The tribe are indiscriminate in their diet, which includes pork, snakes, rats, and even carnivorous animals, as panthers.
They refuse only beef, monkeys and the leavings of others. The wilder Binjhw&#257;rs of the forests will not accept cooked food
from any other caste, but those who live in association with Hindus will take it when cooked without water from a few of the
higher ones. The tribe are not considered as impure. Their dress is very simple, consisting as a rule only of one dirty white
piece of cloth in the case of both men and women. Their hair is unkempt, and they neither oil nor comb it. A genuine Binjhw&#257;r
of the hills wears long frizzled hair with long beard and moustaches, but in the open country they cut their hair and shave
the chin. Every Binjhw&#257;r woman is tattooed either before or just after her marriage, when she has attained to the age of adolescence.
A man will not touch or accept food from a woman who is not tattooed on the feet. The expenses must be paid either by the
woman&#8217;s parents or her brothers and not by her husband. The practice is carried to an extreme, and many <a id="d0e8990"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e8990">336</a>]</span>women have the upper part of the chest, the arms from shoulder to wrist, and the feet and legs up to the knee covered with
devices. On the chest and arms the patterns are in the shape of flowers and leaves, while along the leg a succession of zigzag
lines are pricked. The Binjhw&#257;rs are usually cultivators and labourers, while, as already stated, several zam&#299;nd&#257;ri and other
estates are owned by members of the tribe. Binjhw&#257;rs also commonly hold the office of Jh&#257;nkar or priest of the village gods
in the Sambalpur District, as the Baigas do in Mandla and B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t. In Sambalpur the Jh&#257;nkar or village priest is a universal
and recognised village servant of fairly high status. His business is to conduct the worship of the local deities of the soil,
crops, forests and hills, and he generally has a substantial holding, rent free, containing some of the best land in the village.
It is said locally that the Jh&#257;nkar is looked on as the founder of the village, and the representative of the old owners who
were ousted by the Hindus. He worships on their behalf the indigenous deities, with whom he naturally possesses a more intimate
acquaintance than the later immigrants; while the gods of these latter cannot be relied on to exercise a sufficient control
over the works of nature in the foreign land to which they have been imported, or to ensure that the earth and the seasons
will regularly perform their necessary functions in producing sustenance for mankind.

<h3>1. Origin of the sect.</h3>
<p><b>Bishnoi.</b><a id="d0e9050src" href="#d0e9050" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A Hindu sect which has now developed into a caste. The sect was founded in the Punjab, and the Bishnois are immigrants from
northern India. In the Central Provinces they numbered about 1100 persons in 1911, nearly all of whom belonged to the Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d
District. The best description of the sect is contained in Mr. Wilson&#8217;s <i>Sirsa Settlement Report</i> (quoted in Sir E. Maclagan&#8217;s <i>Census Report of the Punjab</i> for 1891), from which the following details are taken: &#8220;The name Bishnoi means a worshipper of Vishnu. The founder of the
sect was a Panw&#257;r R&#257;jp&#363;t named Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji, who was born in a village of Bikaner State in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1451. His father had hitherto remained childless, and being greatly oppressed by this misfortune had been promised a son
by a Muhammadan Fak&#299;r. After nine months Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji was born and showed his miraculous origin in various ways, such as producing
sweets from nothing for the delectation of his companions. Until he was thirty-four years old he spoke no word and was employed
in tending his father&#8217;s cattle. At this time a Br&#257;hman was sent for to get him to speak, and on confessing his failure, Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji
showed his power by lighting a <a id="d0e9065"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9065">338</a>]</span>lamp with a snap of his fingers and spoke his first word. He adopted the life of a teacher and went to reside on a sandhill
some thirty miles south of Bikaner. In 1485 a fearful famine desolated the country, and Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji gained an enormous number
of disciples by providing food for all who would declare their belief in him. He is said to have died on his sandhill at the
good old age of eighty-four, and to have been buried at a spot about a mile distant from it. A further account says that his
body remained suspended for six months in the bier without decomposing. His name Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji was a contraction of Achambha (The
Wonder), with the honorific suffix <i>ji</i>.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9070">
<h3>2. Precepts of Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji.</h3>
<p>&#8220;The sayings (<i>shabd</i>) of Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji, to the number of one hundred and twenty, were recorded by his disciples, and have been handed down in a book
(<i>pothi</i>) which is written in the N&#257;gari character, and in a Hindu dialect similar to B&#257;gri and therefore probably a dialect of R&#257;jasth&#257;ni.
The following is a translation of the twenty-nine precepts given by him for the guidance of his followers: &#8216;For thirty days
after childbirth and five days after a menstrual discharge a woman must not cook food. Bathe in the morning. Commit no adultery.
Be content. Be abstemious and pure. Strain your drinking-water. Be careful of your speech. Examine your fuel in case any living
creature be burnt with it. Show pity to living creatures. Keep duty present to your mind as the teacher bade. Do not steal.
Do not speak evil of others. Do not tell lies. Never quarrel. Avoid opium, tobacco, <i>bh&#257;ng</i> and blue clothing. Flee from spirits and flesh. See that your goats are kept alive (not sold to Musalm&#257;ns, who will kill
them for food). Do not plough with bullocks. Keep a fast on the day before the new moon. Do not cut green trees. Sacrifice
with fire. Say prayers; meditate. Perform worship and attain heaven.&#8217; And the last of the twenty-nine duties prescribed by
the teacher: &#8216;Baptise your children if you would be called a true Bishnoi.&#8217;<a id="d0e9084src" href="#d0e9084" class="noteref">2</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9090">
<h3>3. Customs of the Bishnois in the Punjab.</h3>
<p>&#8220;Some of these precepts are not strictly obeyed. For <a id="d0e9095"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9095">339</a>]</span>instance, though ordinarily they allow no blue in their clothing, yet a Bishnoi, if he is a police constable, is allowed to
wear a blue uniform; and Bishnois do use bullocks, though most of their farming is done with camels. They also seem to be
generally quarrelsome (in words) and given to use bad language. But they abstain from tobacco, drugs and spirits, and are
noted for their regard for animal life, which is such that not only will they not themselves kill any living creature, but
they do their utmost to prevent others from doing so. Consequently their villages are generally swarming with antelope and
other animals, and they forbid their Musalm&#257;n neighbours to kill them, and try to dissuade European sportsmen from interfering
with them. They wanted to make it a condition of their settlement that no one should be allowed to shoot on their land, but
at the same time they asked that they might be assessed at lower rates than their neighbours, on the ground that the antelope,
being thus left undisturbed, did more damage to their crops; but I told them that this would lessen the merit (<i>pun</i>) of their actions in protecting the animals, and they must be treated just as the surrounding villages were. They consider
it a good deed to scatter grain to pigeons and other birds, and often have a large number of half-tame birds about their villages.
The day before the new moon (Am&#257;was) they observe as a Sabbath and fast-day, doing no work in the fields or in the house.
They bathe and pray three times a day, in the morning, afternoon and evening, saying &#8216;Bishnu! Bishnu!&#8217; instead of the ordinary
Hindu &#8216;R&#257;m! R&#257;m.&#8217; Their clothing is the same as that of other B&#257;gris, except that their women do not allow the waist to be
seen, and are fond of wearing black woollen clothing. They are more particular about ceremonial purity than ordinary Hindus
are, and it is a common saying that if a Bishnoi&#8217;s food is on the first of a string of twenty camels and a man of another
caste touches the last camel of the string, the Bishnoi would consider his food defiled and throw it away.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9100">
<h3>4. Initiation and baptism.</h3>
<p>The ceremony of initiation is as follows: &#8220;A number of representative Bishnois assemble, and before them a S&#257;dh or Bishnoi
priest, after lighting a sacrificial fire (<i>hom</i>), instructs the novice in the duties of the faith. He then <a id="d0e9108"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9108">340</a>]</span>takes some water in a new earthen vessel, over which he prays in a set form (<i>Bishno g&#257;yatri</i>), stirring it the while with his string of beads (<i>m&#257;la</i>), and after asking the consent of the assembled Bishnois he pours the water three times into the hands of the novice, who
drinks it off. The novice&#8217;s scalp-lock (<i>choti</i>) is then cut off and his head shaved, for the Bishnois shave the whole head and do not leave a scalp-lock like the Hindus,
but they allow the beard to grow, only shaving the chin on the father&#8217;s death. Infant baptism is also practised, and thirty
days after birth the child, whether boy or girl, is baptised by the priest (S&#257;dh) in much the same way as an adult; only the
set form of prayer is different, and the priest pours a few drops of water into the child&#8217;s mouth, and gives the child&#8217;s relatives
each three handfuls of the consecrated water to drink; at the same time the barber clips off the child&#8217;s hair. The baptismal
ceremony has the effect of purifying the house, which has been made impure by the birth (<i>s&#363;tak</i>).

</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bishnois do not revere Br&#257;hmans, but have priests of their own known as S&#257;dh, who are chosen from among the laity. The
priests are a hereditary class, and do not intermarry with other Bishnois, from whom, like Br&#257;hmans, they receive food and
offerings. The Bishnois do not burn their dead, but bury them below the cattle-shed or in some place like a pen frequented
by cattle. They make pilgrimages to the place where Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji is buried to the south of Bikaner; here a tomb and temple have
been erected to his memory, and gatherings are held twice a year. The sect observe the Holi in a different way from other
Hindus. After sunset on that day they fast till the next forenoon when, after hearing read the account of how Prahl&#257;d was
tortured by his infidel father, Hrianya Kasipu, for believing in the god Vishnu, until he was delivered by the god himself
in his incarnation of Narsingh, the Man-lion, and mourning over Prahl&#257;d&#8217;s sufferings, they light a sacrificial fire and partake
of consecrated water, and after distributing sugar (<i>gur</i>) in commemoration of Prahl&#257;d&#8217;s delivery from the fire into which he was thrown, they break their fast.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9127">
<h3>5. Nature of the sect.</h3>
<p>The above interesting account of the Bishnois by Mr. Wilson shows that Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji was a religious reformer, who <a id="d0e9132"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9132">341</a>]</span>attempted to break loose from the debased Hindu polytheism and arrogant supremacy of the Br&#257;hmans by choosing one god, Vishnu,
out of the Hindu pantheon and exalting him into the sole and supreme deity. In his method he thus differed from Kab&#299;r and
other reformers, who went outside Hinduism altogether, preaching a monotheistic faith with one unseen and nameless deity.
The case of the M&#257;nbhaos, whose unknown founder made Krishna the one god, discarding the Vedas and the rest of Hinduism, is
analogous to Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji&#8217;s movement. His creed much resembles that of the other Hindu reformers and founders of the Vaishnavite
sects. The extreme tenderness for animal life is a characteristic of most of them, and would be fostered by the Hindu belief
in the transmigration of souls. The prohibition of liquor is another common feature, to which Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji added that of all kinds
of drugs. His mind, like those of Kab&#299;r and N&#257;nak, was probably influenced by the spectacle of the comparatively liberal creed
of Isl&#257;m, which had now taken root in northern India. Mr. Crooke remarks that the Bishnois of Bijnor appear to differ from
those of the Punjab in using the Muhammadan form of salutation, <i>Sal&#257;m alaikum</i>, and the title of Shaikhji. They account for this by saying they murdered a Muhammadan K&#257;zi, who prevented them from burning
a widow, and were glad to compound the offence by pretending to adopt Isl&#257;m. But it seems possible that on their first rupture
with Hinduism they were to some extent drawn towards the Muhammadans, and adopted practices of which, on tending again to
conform to their old religion, they have subsequently become ashamed.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9137">
<h3>6. Bishnois in the Central Provinces.</h3>
<p>In northern India the members of different castes who have become Bishnois have formed separate endogamous groups, of which
Mr. Crooke gives nine; among these are the Br&#257;hman, Bania, J&#257;t, Sun&#257;r, Ah&#299;r and Nai Bishnois. Only members of comparatively
good castes appear to have been admitted into the community, and in the Punjab they are nearly all J&#257;ts and Banias. In the
Central Provinces the caste forms only one endogamous group. They have <i>gotras</i> or exogamous sections, the names of which appear to be of the titular or territorial type. Some of the <i>gotras</i>, <a id="d0e9148"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9148">342</a>]</span>Jhuria, Ajna, Sain and Ah&#299;r,<a id="d0e9150src" href="#d0e9150" class="noteref">3</a> are considered to be lower than the others, and though they are not debarred from intermarriage, a connection with them is
looked upon as something of a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>. They are not consulted in the settlement of tribal disputes. No explanation of the comparatively degraded position of these
septs is forthcoming, but it may probably be attributed to some blot in their ancestral escutcheon. The Bishnois celebrate
their marriages at any period of the year, and place no reliance on astrology. According to their saying, &#8220;Every day is as
good as Sankr&#257;nt,<a id="d0e9156src" href="#d0e9156" class="noteref">4</a> every day is as good as Am&#257;was.<a id="d0e9159src" href="#d0e9159" class="noteref">5</a> The Ganges flows every day, and he whose preceptor has taught him the most truth will get the most good from bathing in it.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9162">
<h3>7. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Before a wedding the bride&#8217;s father sends, by the barber, a cocoanut and a silver ring tied round it with a yellow thread.
On the thread are seven, nine, eleven or thirteen knots, signifying the number of days to elapse before the ceremony. The
barber on his arrival stands outside the door of the house, and the bridegroom&#8217;s father sends round to all the families of
his caste. The men go to the house and the women come singing to the barber, and rub turmeric on the boy. A married woman
touches the cocoanut and waves a lighted lamp seven times round the bridegroom&#8217;s head. This is meant to scare off evil spirits.
On arrival at the bride&#8217;s village the bridegroom touches the marriage-shed with the branch of a <i>ber</i> or wild plum tree. The mother of the bride gives him some sugar, rubs lamp-black on his eyes and twists his nose. The bride
and bridegroom are seated side by side on wooden boards, and after the caste priest (S&#257;dh) has chanted some sacred verses,
water is poured nine times on to the palms of the bridegroom, and he drinks it. They do not perform the ceremony of walking
round the sacred pole. Girls are usually married at a very early age, sometimes when they are only a few months old. Subsequently,
when the bridegroom <a id="d0e9170"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9170">343</a>]</span>comes to take his bride, her family present her with clothing and a spinning-wheel, this implement being still in favour among
the Bishnois. When a widow is to be married again she is taken to her new husband&#8217;s house at night, and there grinds a flour-mill
five times, being afterwards presented with lac bangles.

<div class="div2" id="d0e9172">
<h3>8. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
<p>The dead are never burnt, but their bodies are weighted with sand-bags and thrown into a stream. The practice which formerly
prevailed among the Bishnois of burying their dead in the courtyard of the house by the cattle-stalls has now fallen into
desuetude as being insanitary. A red cloth is spread over the body of a woman, and if her maternal relatives are present each
of them places a piece of cloth on the bier. After the funeral the mourning party proceed to a river to bathe, and then cook
and eat their food on the bank. This custom is also followed by the Panw&#257;r R&#257;jp&#363;ts of the Wainganga Valley, but is forbidden
by most of the good Hindu castes. No period of impurity is observed after a death, but on some day between the fourth and
tenth days afterwards a feast is given to the caste-fellows.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9177">
<h3>9. Development into a caste.</h3>
<p>The Bishnois of the Central Provinces are gradually becoming an ordinary Hindu caste, a fate which has several times befallen
the adherents of Hindu reformers. Many of the precepts of Jh&#257;mb&#257;ji are neglected. They still usually strain their water and
examine their fuel before burning it to remove insects, and they scatter flour to feed the ants and grain for peacocks and
pigeons. The wearing of blue cloth is avoided by most, blue being for an obscure reason a somewhat unlucky colour among the
Hindus. But they now use bullocks for ploughing, and cut green trees except on the Am&#257;was day. Many of them, especially the
younger generation, have begun to grow the Hindu <i>choti</i> or scalp-lock. They go on pilgrimage to all the Hindu sacred places, and no doubt make presents there to Br&#257;hman priests.
They offer <i>pindas</i> or sacrificial cakes to the spirits of their deceased ancestors. They observe some of the ordinary Hindu festivals, as the
Anant Chaturthi, and some of them employ Br&#257;hmans to read the Satya N&#257;r&#257;yan Katha, the favourite Hindu sacred book. They still
retain their special <a id="d0e9188"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9188">344</a>]</span>observance of the Holi. The admission of proselytes has practically ceased, and they marry among themselves like an ordinary
Hindu caste, in which light they are gradually coming to be regarded. The Bishnois are usually cultivators or moneylenders
by calling.

<h3>1. Origin of the sect.</h3>
<p><b>Bohra, Bohora.</b><a id="d0e9238src" href="#d0e9238" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A Muhammadan caste of traders who come from Gujar&#257;t and speak Gujar&#257;ti. At the last census they numbered nearly 5000 persons,
residing principally in the Nim&#257;r, N&#257;gpur and Amraoti Districts, Burh&#257;npur being the headquarters of the sect in the Central
Provinces. The name is probably derived from the Hindi <i>byoh&#257;ra</i>, a trader. Members of the caste are honorifically addressed as Mull&#257;ji. According to the received account of the rise of
the Bohras in Gujar&#257;t a missionary, Abdulla, came from Yemen to Cambay in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1067. By his miracles he converted the great king Sidhr&#257;j of Anhilv&#257;da P&#257;tan in Gujar&#257;t, and he with numbers of his subjects
embraced the new faith. For two centuries and a half the Bohras flourished, but with the establishment of Muzaffar Sh&#257;h&#8217;s
power (<span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1390&#8211;1413) in that country the spread of Sunni doctrines was encouraged and the Bohra and other Shia sects suppressed. Since
then, with gradually lessening numbers, they have passed through several bitter persecutions, meeting with little favour or
protection, till at the close of the eighteenth century they found shelter under British rule. In 1539 the members of the
sect living in Arabia were expelled from there and came to Gujar&#257;t, where they were hospitably received by their brethren,
the headquarters of the sect being thenceforward <a id="d0e9253"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9253">346</a>]</span>fixed at Surat. The Bohras are Shias of the great Ismailia sect of Egypt. The Ismailia sect split off from the orthodox Shias
on the question of the succession to the sixth Im&#257;m, J&#257;far S&#257;dik, in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 765. The dispute was between his eldest son&#8217;s son Ismail and his second son Musi, the Ismailias being those who supported
the former and the orthodox Shias the latter. The orthodox Shias are distinguished as believers in twelve Im&#257;ms, the last
of whom is still to come. The Ismailias again divided on a similar dispute as to the succession to the Khal&#299;fa Almustansir
Billah by his eldest son Naz&#257;r or his younger son Almusta&#257;li. The Bohras are descended from the Musta&#257;lians or supporters
of the younger son and the Khojas from the Naz&#257;rians who supported the elder son.<a id="d0e9258src" href="#d0e9258" class="noteref">2</a> All these distinctions appear somewhat trivial.

<div class="div2" id="d0e9267">
<h3>2. Their religious tenets.</h3>
<p>Gujar&#257;t contains two classes of Bohras: the traders who are all Shias and are the only immigrants into the Central Provinces,
and a large class of cultivating Bohras who are Sunnis. The latter may be the descendants of the earliest converts and may
have been forced to become Sunnis when this sect was dominant in Gujar&#257;t as noticed above, while the Shias are perhaps descended
from the later immigrants from Arabia. The Shia Bohras themselves are further divided into several sects of which the D&#257;udi
are the principal.

</p>
<p>Mr. Far&#299;di writes of them:<a id="d0e9274src" href="#d0e9274" class="noteref">3</a> &#8220;They are attentive to their religious duties, both men and women knowing the Kor&#257;n. They are careful to say their prayers,
to observe Muharram as a season of mourning and to go on pilgrimage to Mecca and Kerbala. They strictly abstain from music
and dancing and from using or dealing in intoxicating drinks or drugs. Though fierce sectarians, keenly hating and hated by
the regular Sunnis and other Muhammadans than those of their own sect, their reverence for Ali and for their high priest seems
to be further removed from adoration than among the Khojahs. They would appear to accept the ordinary distinctions of right
and wrong, punishing drunkenness, adultery and other acts generally considered <a id="d0e9279"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9279">347</a>]</span>disgraceful. Of the state beyond death they hold that, after passing a time of freedom as evil spirits, unbelievers go to
a place of torment. Believers, but apparently only believers of the Ismaili faith, after a term of training enter a state
of perfection. Among the faithful each disembodied spirit passes the term of training in communion with the soul of some good
man. The spirit can suggest good or evil to the man and may learn from his good deeds to love the right; when the good man
dies the spirits in communion with his soul are, if they have gained by their training, attached to some more perfect man,
or if they have lost by their opportunities are sent back to learn; spirits raised to a higher degree of knowledge are placed
in communion with the High Priest on earth; and on his death are with him united to the Im&#257;ms, and when through the Im&#257;ms
they have learnt what they still require to know they are absorbed in perfection. Except for some peculiarities in their names;
that they attach special importance to circumcision; that the sacrifice or <i>alsikah</i> ceremony is held in the Mullah&#8217;s house; that at marriage the bride and bridegroom when not of age are represented by sponsors
or <i>walis</i>; that at death a prayer for pity on his soul and body is laid in the dead man&#8217;s hands; and that on certain occasions the
High Priest feeds the whole community&#8212;Bohra customs do not so far as has been ascertained differ from those of ordinary Muhammadans.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9287">
<h3>3. The Mullahs.</h3>
<p>&#8220;Their leader, both in things religious and social, is the head Mullah of Surat. The ruling Mullah names his successor, generally,
but it is said not always, from among the members of his own family. Short of worship the head Mullah is treated with the
greatest respect. He lives in much state and entertains with the most profuse liberality. On both religious and civil questions
his authority is final. Discipline is enforced in religious matters by fine, and in case of adultery, drunkenness and other
offences, by fine, excommunication and rarely by flogging. On ceremonial occasions the head Mullah sits on his throne, and
in token of his power has the flyflapper, <i>chauri</i>, held before him. As the Bohras enter they make three prostrations, <i>salaams</i>, close their hands and stand before him. To such as are worthy <a id="d0e9298"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9298">348</a>]</span>he says &#8216;Be seated,&#8217; to others &#8216;Stand.&#8217; Once a year, on the 18th Rajjab, every D&#257;udi lays his palm within the head Mullah&#8217;s
hand and takes an oath to be faithful. On this day when he goes to the mosque the Bohras are said to kiss the Mullah&#8217;s footsteps
and to apply the dust he treads to their heads and eyes.&#8221; Each considerable settlement of the sect has a deputy Mullah of
its own.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9300">
<h3>4. Bohra graveyards.</h3>
<p>The Sahadra or burial-place of the Bohras at Burh&#257;npur contains the tombs of three of the Surat Mullahs who happened to die
when they were at Burh&#257;npur. The tombs are in shell-lime and are fairly handsome erections. The Bohras support here by voluntary
subscription a rest-house, where members of the sect coming to the city can obtain free board and lodging for as long as they
like to stay. Mr. Conolly says of their graveyards:<a id="d0e9305src" href="#d0e9305" class="noteref">4</a>

</p>
<p>&#8220;Their burial-grounds have a pleasing appearance, the tombs being regularly arranged in streets, east and west. The tombs
themselves, which are, of course, north and south, the corpse resting on its right side, differ in no respect from those of
Sunnis, with the exception of a small <i>chir&#257;gh takia</i> or lamp-socket, cut out of the north face, just like the cavity for the inscription of our own tombs.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9315">
<h3>5. Religious customs.</h3>
<p>Of their religion Mr. Kitts writes:<a id="d0e9320src" href="#d0e9320" class="noteref">5</a> &#8220;In prayers they differ both from Shias and Sunnis in that they follow their Mullah, praying aloud after him, but without
much regularity of posture. The times for commencing their devotions are about five minutes later than those observed by Sunnis.
After the midday and sunset supplications they allow a short interval to elapse, remaining themselves in the mosque meanwhile.
They then commence the afternoon and evening prayers and thus run five services into three.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Mr. Thurston notes that the Bohras consider themselves so superior to other sects that if another Muhammadan enters their
mosque they afterwards clean the spot which he has occupied during his prayers.<a id="d0e9327src" href="#d0e9327" class="noteref">6</a> They show strictness in other ways, making their own sweetmeats at home and declining to eat those of the Halwai (confectioner).
It is said <a id="d0e9332"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9332">349</a>]</span>also that they will not have their clothes washed by a Dhobi, nor wear shoes made by a Cham&#257;r, nor take food touched by any
Hindu. They are said to bathe only on Fridays, and some of them not on every Friday. If a dog touches them they are unclean
and must change their clothes. They celebrate the Id and Ramaz&#257;n a day before other Muhammadans. At the Muharram their women
break all their bangles and wear new bangles next day to show that they have been widowed, and during this period they observe
mourning by going without shoes and not using umbrellas. Mr. Conolly says of them: &#8220;I must not omit to notice that a fine
of 20 cowries (equally for rich and poor) punishes the non-attendance of a Bohra at the daily prayers. A large sum is exacted
for remissness during the Ramaz&#257;n, and it is said that the dread of loss operates powerfully upon a class of men who are particularly
penny-wise. The money collected thus is transmitted by the Ujjain Mullah to his chief at Surat, who devotes it to religious
purposes such as repairing or building mosques, assisting the needy of his subjects and the like. Several other offences have
the same characteristic punishment, such as fornication, drunkenness, etc. But the cunning Bohras elude many of the fines
and daily indulge in practices not sanctioned by their creed; thus in their shops pictures and figures may be purchased though
it is against the commandments to sell the likeness of any living thing.&#8221;

</p>
<p>It has been seen that when a Bohra is buried a prayer for pity on his soul and body is laid in the dead man&#8217;s hands, of which
Mr. Far&#299;di gives the text. But other Muhammadans tell a story to the effect that the head Mullah writes a letter to the archangel
Gabriel in which he is instructed to supply a stream of honey, a stream of milk, water and some fruit trees, a golden building
and a number of houris, the extent of the order depending on the amount of money which has been paid to the Mullah by the
departed in his lifetime; and this letter is placed beneath the dead man&#8217;s head in the grave, the Bohras having no coffins.
The Bohras indignantly repudiate any such version of the letter, and no doubt if the custom ever existed it has died out.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9336">
<h3>6. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The Bohras, Captain Forsyth remarks, though bigoted <a id="d0e9341"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9341">350</a>]</span>religionists, are certainly the most civilised and enterprising and perhaps also the most industrious class in the Nim&#257;r District.
They deal generally in hardware, piece-goods and drugs, and are very keen traders. There is a proverb, &#8220;He who is sharper
than a Bohra must be mad, and he who is fairer than a Khatri must be a leper.&#8221; Some of them are only pedlars and hawkers,
and in past times their position seems to have been lower than at present. An old account says:<a id="d0e9343src" href="#d0e9343" class="noteref">7</a> &#8220;The Bohras are an inferior set of travelling merchants. The inside of a Bohra&#8217;s box is like that of an English country shop;
spelling-books, prayer-books, lavender-water, soap, tapes, scissors, knives, needles and thread make but a small part of the
variety.&#8221; And again: &#8220;In Bombay the Bohras go about the town as the dirty Jews do in London early and late, carrying a bag
and inviting by the same nasal tone servants and others to fill it with old clothes, empty bottles, scraps of iron, etc.&#8221;<a id="d0e9349src" href="#d0e9349" class="noteref">8</a>

<h3>7. Houses and dress.</h3>
<p>Of their method of living Malcolm wrote:<a id="d0e9360src" href="#d0e9360" class="noteref">9</a> &#8220;I visited several of the houses of this tribe at Sh&#257;hjah&#257;npur, where a colony of them are settled, and was gratified to
find not only in their apartments, but in the spaciousness and cleanliness of their kitchens, in the well-constructed chimney,
the neatly arranged pantries, and the polished dishes and plates as much of real comfort in domestic arrangements as could
be found anywhere. We took the parties we visited by surprise and there could have been no preparation.&#8221; The Bohras do not
charge interest on loans, and they combine to support indigent members of the community, never allowing one of their caste
to beg. The caste may easily be known from other Muhammadans by their small, tightly wound turbans and little skull-caps,
and their long flowing robes, and loose trousers widening from the ankle upwards and gathered in at the waist with a string.
The women dress in a coloured cotton or silk petticoat, a short-sleeved bodice and a coloured cotton head-scarf. When they
go out of doors they throw a dark cloak over the head which covers the body to the ankles, with gauze openings for the eyes.

<h3>1. Origin and development of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Br&#257;hman, B&#257;man.</b>&#8212;The well-known priestly caste of India and the first of the four traditional castes of the Hindu scriptures. In 1911 the
Br&#257;hmans numbered about 450,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r, or <a id="d0e9543"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9543">352</a>]</span>nearly 3 per cent of the population. This is less than the average strength for India as a whole, which is about 4&frac12; per cent.
The caste is spread over the whole Province, but is in greatest numbers in proportion to the population in Saugor and Jubbulpore,
and weakest in the Feudatory States.

</p>
<p>The name Br&#257;hman or Brahma is said to be from the root <i>brih</i> or <i>vrih</i>, to increase. The god Brahma is considered as the spirit and soul of the universe, the divine essence and source of all being.
Br&#257;hmana, the masculine numerative singular, originally denoted one who prays, a worshipper or the composer or reciter of
a hymn.<a id="d0e9553src" href="#d0e9553" class="noteref">2</a> It is the common term used in the Vedas for the officiating priest. Sir H. Risley remarks on the origin of the caste:<a id="d0e9562src" href="#d0e9562" class="noteref">3</a> &#8220;The best modern opinion seems disposed to find the germ of the Br&#257;hman caste in the bards, ministers and family priests
who were attached to the king&#8217;s household in Vedic times. Different stages of this institution may be observed. In the earliest
ages the head of every Aryan household was his own priest, and even a king would himself perform the sacrifices which were
appropriate to his rank. By degrees families or guilds of priestly singers arose, who sought service under the kings, and
were rewarded by rich presents for the hymns or praise and prayer recited and sacrifices offered by them on behalf of their
masters. As time went on the sacrifices became more numerous and more elaborate, and the mass of ritual grew to such an extent
that the king could no longer cope with it unaided. The employment of <i>purohits</i> or family priests, formerly optional, now became a sacred duty if the sacrifices were not to fall into disuse. The Br&#257;hman
obtained a monopoly of priestly functions, and a race of sacerdotal specialists arose which tended continually to close its
ranks against the intrusion of outsiders.&#8221; Gradually then from the household priests and those who made it their business
to commit to memory and recite the sacred hymns and verses handed down orally from generation to generation through this agency,
an <a id="d0e9570"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9570">353</a>]</span>occupational caste emerged, which arrogated to itself the monopoly of these functions, and the doctrine developed that nobody
could perform them who was not qualified by birth, that is, nobody could be a Br&#257;hman who was not the son of a Br&#257;hman. When
religious ritual became more important, as apparently it did, a desire would naturally arise among the priests to make their
revered and lucrative profession a hereditary monopoly; and this they were easily and naturally able to do by only teaching
the sacred songs and the sacrificial rules and procedure to their own descendants. The process indeed would be to a considerable
extent automatic, because the priests would always take their own sons for their pupils in the first place, and in the circumstances
of early Indian society a married priesthood would thus naturally evolve into a hereditary caste. The Levites among the Jews
and the priests of the P&#257;rsis formed similar hereditary orders, and the reason why they did not arise in other great religions
would appear to have been the prescription or encouragement of the rule of celibacy for the clergy and the foundation of monasteries,
to which admission was free. But the military landed aristocracies of Europe practically formed hereditary castes which were
analogous to the Br&#257;hman and R&#257;jp&#363;t castes, though of a less stereotyped and primitive character. The rise of the Br&#257;hman
caste was thus perhaps a comparatively simple and natural product of religious and social evolution, and might have occurred
independently of the development of the caste system as a whole. The former might be accounted for by reasons which would
be inadequate to explain the latter, even though as a matter of fact the same factors were at work in both cases.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9572">
<h3>2. Their monopoly of literature.</h3>
<p>The hereditary monopoly of the sacred scriptures would be strengthened and made absolute when the Sanskrit language, in which
they had been composed and handed down, ceased to be the ordinary spoken language of the people. Nobody then could learn them
unless he was taught by a Br&#257;hman priest. And by keeping the sacred literature in an unknown language the priesthood made
their own position absolutely secure and got into their own hands the allocation of the penalties and rewards promised <a id="d0e9577"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9577">354</a>]</span>by religion, for which these books were the authority, that is to say, the disposal of the souls of Hindus in the afterlife.
They, in fact, held the keys of heaven and hell. The jealousy with which they guarded them is well shown by the Abb&eacute; Dubois:<a id="d0e9579src" href="#d0e9579" class="noteref">4</a> &#8220;To the Br&#257;hmans alone belongs the right of reading the Vedas, and they are so jealous of this, or rather it is so much to
their interest to prevent other castes obtaining any insight into their contents, that the Br&#257;hmans have inculcated the absurd
theory, which is implicitly believed, that should anybody of any other caste be so highly imprudent as even to read the title-page
his head would immediately split in two. The very few Br&#257;hmans who are able to read those sacred books in the original, only
do so in secret and in a whisper. Expulsion from caste, without the smallest hope of re-entering it, would be the lightest
punishment of a Br&#257;hman who exposed those books to the eyes of the profane.&#8221; It would probably be unfair, however, to suppose
that the Vedas were kept in the original Sanskrit simply from motives of policy. It was probably thought that the actual words
of the sacred text had themselves a concrete force and potency which would be lost in a translation. This is the idea underlying
the whole class of beliefs in the virtue of charms and spells.

</p>
<p>But the Br&#257;hmans had the monopoly not only of the sacred Sanskrit literature, but practically of any kind of literacy or education.
They were for long the only literate section of the people. Subsequently two other castes learnt to read and write in response
to an economic demand, the K&#257;yasths and the Banias. The K&#257;yasths, it has been suggested in the article on that caste, were
to a large extent the offspring and inmates of the households of Br&#257;hmans, and were no doubt taught by them, but only to read
and write the vernacular for the purpose of keeping the village records and accounts of rent. They were excluded from any
knowledge of Sanskrit, and the K&#257;yasths subsequently became an educated caste in spite of their Br&#257;hman preceptors, by learning
Persian under their Muhammadan, and English under their European employers. The Banias never desired nor were encouraged to
attain to any higher <a id="d0e9586"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9586">355</a>]</span>degree of literacy than that necessary for keeping accounts of sale and loan transactions. The Br&#257;hmans thus remained the
only class with any real education, and acquired a monopoly not only of intellectual and religious leadership, but largely
of public administration under the Hindu kings. No literature existed outside their own, which was mainly of a sacerdotal
character; and India had no heritage such as that bequeathed by Greece and Rome to mediaeval Europe which could produce a
Renaissance or revival of literacy, leading to the Reformation of religion and the breaking of the fetters in which the Roman
priesthood had bound the human mind. The Br&#257;hmans thus established, not only a complete religious, but also a social ascendancy
which is only now beginning to break down since the British Government has made education available to all.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9588">
<h3>3. Absence of central authority.</h3>
<p>The Br&#257;hman body, however, lacked one very important element of strength. They were apparently never organised nor controlled
by any central authority such as that which made the Roman church so powerful and cohesive. Colleges and seats of learning
existed at Ben&#257;res and other places, at which their youth were trained in the knowledge of religion and of the measure of
their own pretensions, and the means by which these were to be sustained. But probably only a small minority can have attended
them, and even these when they returned home must have been left practically to themselves, spread as the Br&#257;hmans were over
the whole of India with no means of postal communication or rapid transit. And by this fact the chaotic character of the Hindu
religion, its freedom of belief and worship, its innumerable deities, and the almost complete absence of dogmas may probably
be to a great extent explained. And further the Br&#257;hman caste itself cannot have been so strictly organised that outsiders
and the priests of the lower alien religions never obtained entrance to it. As shown by Mr. Crooke, many foreign elements,
both individuals and groups, have at various times been admitted into the caste.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9593">
<h3>4. Mixed elements in the caste.</h3>
<p>The early texts indicate that Br&#257;hmans were in the habit of forming connections with the widows of R&#257;janyas and Vaishyas,
even if they did not take possession of the <a id="d0e9598"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9598">356</a>]</span>wives of such men while they were still alive.<a id="d0e9600src" href="#d0e9600" class="noteref">5</a> The sons of Angiras, one of the great ancestral sages, were Br&#257;hmans as well as Kshatriyas. The descendants of Garga, another
well-known eponymous ancestor, were Kshatriyas by birth but became Br&#257;hmans. Visv&#257;mitra was a Kshatriya, who, by the force
of his austerities, compelled Brahma to admit him into the Br&#257;hmanical order, so that he might be on a level with Vasishtha
with whom he had quarrelled. According to a passage in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata all castes become Br&#257;hmans when once they have crossed
the Gomti on a pilgrimage to the hermitage of Vasishtha.<a id="d0e9608src" href="#d0e9608" class="noteref">6</a> In more recent times there are legends of persons created Br&#257;hmans by Hindu R&#257;jas. Sir J. Malcolm in Central India found
many low-caste female slaves in Br&#257;hman houses, the owners of which had treated them as belonging to their own caste.<a id="d0e9614src" href="#d0e9614" class="noteref">7</a>

</p>
<p>It would appear also that in some cases the caste priests of different castes have become Br&#257;hmans. Thus the S&#257;raswat Br&#257;hmans
of the Punjab are the priests of the Khatri caste. They have the same complicated arrangement of exogamy and hypergamy as
the Khatris, and will take food from that caste. It seems not improbable that they are really descendants of Khatri priests
who have become Br&#257;hmans.<a id="d0e9619src" href="#d0e9619" class="noteref">8</a>

</p>
<p>Similarly such groups as the Osw&#257;l, Srim&#257;l and Palliw&#257;l Br&#257;hmans of R&#257;jput&#257;na, who are priests of the subcastes of Banias
of the same name, may originally have been caste priests and become Br&#257;hmans. The N&#257;ramdeo Br&#257;hmans, or those living on the
Nerbudda River, are said to be descendants of a Br&#257;hman father by a woman of the Naoda or Dh&#299;mar caste; and the Golap&#363;rab
Br&#257;hmans similarly of a Br&#257;hman father and Ah&#299;r mother. In many cases, such as the island of Onkar Mandh&#257;ta in the Nerbudda
in Nim&#257;r, and the Mah&#257;deo caves at Pachmarhi, the places of worship of the non-Aryan tribes have been adopted by Hinduism
and the old mountain or river gods transformed into Hindu deities. At the same time it is not improbable that the tribal priests
of the old shrines have been admitted into the Br&#257;hman caste.

<div class="div2" id="d0e9628">
<h3>5. Caste subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The Br&#257;hman caste has ten main territorial divisions, forming two groups, the P&#257;nch-Gaur or five northern, and the P&#257;nch-Dr&#257;vida
or five southern. The boundary line between the two groups is supposed to be the Nerbudda River, which is also the boundary
between Hindust&#257;n and the Deccan. But the Gujar&#257;ti Br&#257;hmans belong to the southern group, though Gujar&#257;t is north of the Nerbudda.
The five northern divisions are:

</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>S&#257;raswat.</i>&#8212;These belong to the Punjab and are named after the S&#257;raswati river of the classical period, on whose banks they are supposed
to have lived.

</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Gaur.</i>&#8212;The home of these is the country round Delhi, but they say that the name is from the old Gaur or Lakhnauti kingdom of Bengal.
If this is correct, it is difficult to understand how they came from Bengal to Delhi contrary to the usual tendency of migration.
General Cunningham has suggested that Gaura was also the name of the modern Gonda District, and it is possible that the term
was once used for a considerable tract in northern India as well as Bengal, since it has come to be applied to all the northern
Br&#257;hmans.<a id="d0e9649src" href="#d0e9649" class="noteref">9</a>

</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>K&#257;nkubja or Kanaujia.</i>&#8212;These are named after the old town of Kanauj on the Ganges near Cawnpore, once the capital of India. The Kanaujia are the
most important of the northern groups and extend from the west of Oudh to beyond Ben&#257;res and into the northern Districts of
the Central Provinces. Here they are subdivided into four principal groups&#8212;the Kanaujia, Jijhotia, Sarwaria and San&#257;dhya,
which are treated in annexed subordinate articles.

</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Maithil.</i>&#8212;They take their name from Mithila, the old term for Bih&#257;r or Tirh&#363;t, and belong to this tract.

</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Utkal.</i>&#8212;These are the Br&#257;hmans of Orissa.

</p>
<p>The five groups of the P&#257;nch-Dr&#257;vida are as follows:

</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Mahar&#257;shtra.</i>&#8212;These belong to the Mar&#257;tha country or Bombay. They are subdivided into three main territorial groups&#8212;the Deshasth, or those
of the home country, that is the Poona tract above the Western Gh&#257;ts; the Konkonasth, who belong to the Bombay Konkan or littoral;
<a id="d0e9686"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9686">358</a>]</span>and the Karh&#257;ra, named after a place in the Sat&#257;ra District.<a id="d0e9688src" href="#d0e9688" class="noteref">10</a>

</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Tailanga or Andhra.</i>&#8212;The Br&#257;hmans of the Telugu country, Hyder&#257;b&#257;d and the northern part of Madras. This territory was known as Andhra and governed
by an important dynasty of the same name in early times.

</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Dr&#257;vida.</i>&#8212;The Br&#257;hmans of the Tamil country or the south of Madras.

</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Karn&#257;ta.</i>&#8212;The Br&#257;hmans of the Carnatic, or the Canarese country. The Canarese area comprises the Mysore State, and the British Districts
of Canara, Dharwar and Belgaum.

</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Gurjara.</i>&#8212;The Br&#257;hmans of Gujar&#257;t, of whom two subcastes are found in the Central Provinces. The first consists of the Khed&#257;w&#257;ls, named
after Kheda, a village in Gujar&#257;t, who are a strictly orthodox class holding a good position in the caste. And the second
are the N&#257;gar Br&#257;hmans, who have been long settled in Nim&#257;r and the adjacent tracts, and act as village priests and astrologers.
Their social status is somewhat lower.

</p>
<p>There are, however, a large number of other subcastes, and the tendency to fissure in a large caste, and to the formation
of small local groups which marry among themselves, is nowhere more strikingly apparent than among the Br&#257;hmans. This is only
natural, as they, more than any other caste, attach importance to strict ceremonial observance in matters of food and the
daily ritual of prayer, and any group which was suspected of backsliding in respect of these on emigration to a new locality
would be debarred from intermarriage with the parent caste at home. An instance of this is found among the Chhatt&#299;sgarhi Br&#257;hmans,
who have been long settled in this backward tract and cut off from communication with northern India. They are mainly of the
Kanaujia division, but the Kanaujias of Oudh will neither take food nor intermarry with them, and they now constitute a separate
subcaste of Kanaujias. Similarly the M&#257;lwi Br&#257;hmans, whose home is in M&#257;lwa, whence they have spread to Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d and Betul,
are believed to have been originally a branch of the Gaur or Kanaujia, <a id="d0e9725"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9725">359</a>]</span>but have now become a distinct subcaste, and have adopted many of the customs of Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans. Mandla contains a colony
of Sarwaria<a id="d0e9727src" href="#d0e9727" class="noteref">11</a> Br&#257;hmans who received grants of villages from the Gond kings and have settled down there. They are now cultivators, and some
have taken to the plough, while they also permit widow-remarriage in all but the name. They are naturally cut off from intercourse
with the orthodox Sarwarias and marry among themselves. The Harenia Br&#257;hmans of Saugor are believed to have immigrated from
Hari&#257;na some generations ago and form a separate local group; and also the Laheria Br&#257;hmans of the same District, who, like
the Mandla Sarwarias, permit widows to marry. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d there is a small subcaste of Baw&#299;sa or &#8216;Twenty-two&#8217; Br&#257;hmans,
descended from twenty-two families from northern India, who settled here and have since married among themselves. A similar
diversity of subcastes is found in other Provinces. The Br&#257;hmans of Bengal are also mainly of the Kanaujia division, but they
are divided into several local subcastes, of which the principal are R&#257;rhi and Barendra, named after tracts in Bengal, and
quite distinct from the subdivisions of the Kanaujia group in the Central Provinces.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9730">
<h3>6. Miscellaneous groups.</h3>
<p>Another class of local subdivisions consists of those Br&#257;hmans who live on the banks of the various sacred rivers or at famous
shrines, and earn their livelihood by conducting pilgrims through the series of ceremonies and acts of worship which are performed
on a visit to such places; they receive presents from the pilgrims and the offerings made at the shrines. The most prominent
among these are the Gayaw&#257;ls of Gaya, the Pray&#257;gw&#257;ls of Allah&#257;b&#257;d (Pray&#257;g), the Chaubes of Mathura, the Gangap&#363;tras (Sons
of the Ganges) of Ben&#257;res, the Pandar&#257;ms of southern India and the N&#257;ramdeo Br&#257;hmans who hold charge of the many temples on
the Nerbudda. As such men accept gifts from pilgrims they are generally looked down on by good Br&#257;hmans and marry among themselves.
Many of them have a character for extortion and for fleecing their clients, a propensity commonly developed in a profession
of this kind. Such a reputation particularly attaches to the Chaubes of Mathura <a id="d0e9735"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9735">360</a>]</span>and Brind&#257;ban, the holy places of the god Krishna. They are strong and finely built men, but gluttonous, idle and dissolute.
Some of the Ben&#257;res Br&#257;hmans are known as Sawal&#257;khi, or having one and a quarter lakhs, apparently on account of the wealth
they amass from pilgrims. A much lower group are the Mah&#257;-Br&#257;hmans (great Br&#257;hmans), who are also known as Pat&#299;t (degraded)
or Katia. These accept the gifts offered by the relatives after a death for the use of the dead man in the next world during
the period of mourning; they also eat food which it is supposed will benefit the dead man, and are considered to represent
him. Probably on this account they share in the impurity attaching to the dead, and are despised by all castes and sometimes
not permitted to live in the village. Other Br&#257;hmans are degraded on account of their having partly adopted Muhammadan practices.
The Husaini Br&#257;hmans of western India are so called as they combine Muhammadan with Hindu rites. They are principally beggars.
And the Kalanki Br&#257;hmans of Wardha and other Districts are looked down upon because, it is said, that at the bidding of a
Muhammadan governor they make a figure of a cow from sugar and eat it up. Probably they may have really acted as priests to
Muhammadans who were inclined to adopt certain Hindu rites on the principle of imitation, and with a view to please their
disciples conformed to some extent to Isl&#257;m.

<div class="div2" id="d0e9737">
<h3>7. Sectarian divisions.</h3>
<p>Br&#257;hmans have also sectarian divisions according to the different Vedas, which they especially study. It is held that the
ancient Rishis or saints, like the Jewish patriarchs, lived far beyond the ordinary span of existence, and hence had time
to learn all the Vedas and their commentaries. But this was impossible for their shorter-lived descendants, and hence each
Veda has been divided into a number of Sh&#257;khas or branches, and the ordinary Br&#257;hman only learns one Sh&#257;kha of one Veda. Most
Br&#257;hmans of the Central Provinces are either Rigvedis or Yajurvedis, and these commonly marry only followers of their own
Veda, thus forming a sort of cross set of endogamous divisions. The restriction on marriage may also extend to the Sh&#257;kha,
so that a man can only marry in a family of the same Sh&#257;kha <a id="d0e9742"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9742">361</a>]</span>as himself. This applies in the Central Provinces mainly to the Yajurvedis, who have three well-known Sh&#257;khas or branches
called K&#257;nnava, Apastambha and M&#257;dhyandina. These are derived from the Shukla or White Yajurveda, which can be understood,
while the Black Yajurveda is obscure and unintelligible. The Rigvedis and Yajurvedis have some differences in their methods
of recitation. The Rigvedis are said to move the head up and down when they recite and not to use the hands; while the Yajurvedis
swing the hands and body from side to side. It is said that a M&#257;dhyandina cannot say his prayers nor take his food before
midday, and hence the name, which means half the day. These points of distinction are given as stated by the local Br&#257;hmans,
and it is not known whether they would be endorsed by the Pandits. The Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans of the Central Provinces are usually
Rigvedis and the Kanaujia Br&#257;hmans Yajurvedis. Followers of the other two Vedas are practically not found. Among Kanaujia
Br&#257;hmans it is also customary to ask the head of a family with which a marriage is proposed whether he ties a knot in the
right or left half of his Shikha or scalp-lock during his prayers and whether he washes his right or left foot first in the
performance of a religious ceremony.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9744">
<h3>8. Exogamy.</h3>
<p>The exogamous arrangements of the Br&#257;hmans are also very complex. It is said that the Br&#257;hmans are descended from the seven
sons of the god Brahma, who were Bhrigu, Angirasa, Marichi, Atri, Pulaha, Pulastya and Vasishtha. But Pulaha only begot demons
and Pulastya giants, while Vasishtha died and was born again as a descendant of Marichi. Consequently the four ancestors of
the Br&#257;hmans were Bhrigu, Angirasa, Marichi and Atri. But according to another account the ancestors of the Br&#257;hmans were
the seven Rishis or saints who form the constellation of the Great Bear. These were Jamadagni, Bh&#257;radw&#257;j, Gautam, Kashyap,
Vasishtha, Agastya, Atri and Visv&#257;mitra, who makes the eighth and is held to be descended from Atri. These latter saints are
also said to be the descendants of the four original ones, Atri appearing in both lists. But the two lists taken together
make up eleven great saints, who were the eponymous ancestors of the Br&#257;hmans. All the <a id="d0e9749"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9749">362</a>]</span>different subcastes have as a rule exogamous classes tracing their descent from these saints. But each group, such as that
of Bhrigu or Angirasa, contains a large number of exogamous sections usually named after other more recent saints, and intermarriage
is sometimes prohibited among the different sections, which are descended from the same son of Brahma or star of the Great
Bear. The arrangement thus bears a certain resemblance to the classification system of exogamy found among primitive races,
only that the number of groups is now fairly large; but it is said that originally there were only four, from the four sons
of Brahma who gave birth to Br&#257;hmans. The names of other important saints, after whom exogamous sections are most commonly
called, are Garg, Sandilya, Kaushik, Vatsya and Bh&#257;rgava. These five appear sometimes to be held as original ancestors in
addition to the eleven already mentioned. It may be noted that some of the above names of saints have a totemistic character;
for instance, Bh&#257;radw&#257;j means a lark; Kashyap resembles Kachhap, the name for a tortoise; Kaushik may come from the <i>kusha</i> grass; Agastya from the <i>agasti</i> flower, and so on. Within the main group exogamy sometimes also goes by titles or family names. Thus the principal titles
of the Kanaujias are: P&#257;nde, a wise man; Dube, learned in two Vedas; Tiw&#257;ri, learned in three Vedas; Chaube, learned in four
Vedas; Sukul, white or pure; Up&#257;dhya, a teacher; Agnihotri, the priest who performs the fire-sacrifice; Dikshit, the initiator,
and so on. Marriage between persons bearing the same family name tends to be prohibited, as they are considered to be relations.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9757">
<h3>9. Restrictions on marriage.</h3>
<p>The prohibition of marriage within the <i>gotra</i> or exogamous section bars the union of persons related solely through males. In addition to this, according to Hindu law
a Br&#257;hman must not marry a girl of his mother&#8217;s or maternal grandfather&#8217;s <i>gotra</i>, or one who is a <i>sapinda</i> of his father or maternal grandfather. Mr. Joshi states that <i>sapindas</i> are persons related through being particles of the same body. It is also understood that two persons are said to be <i>sapindas</i> when they can offer <i>pindas</i> or funeral cakes to the same ancestor. The rule barring the marriage of <i>sapindas</i> is that two persons cannot marry if they are <a id="d0e9783"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9783">363</a>]</span>both as near as fourth in descent from a common ancestor, and the relationship is derived through the father of either party.
If either is more remote than fourth in descent they apparently could marry. If the relationship of the couple is through
their mothers in each case, then they cannot marry if they are third in descent from the same ancestor, but may do so in the
fourth or subsequent generations. It is of no importance whether the intervening links between the common ancestor and the
proposed couple are male or female; descent is considered to be male if through the father, and female if through the mother.
In practice, marriages are held to be valid between persons fourth in descent from a common ancestor in the case of male relationship,
and third in the case of female relationship, that is, persons having a common greatgrandparent in the male line or a common
grandparent in the female line can marry.

</p>
<p>Other rules are that girls must not be exchanged in marriage between two families, and a man may not marry two sisters, though
he can marry his deceased wife&#8217;s sister. The bride should be both younger in age and shorter in stature than the bridegroom.
A younger sister should not be married while her elder sister is single.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9787">
<h3>10. Hypergamy.</h3>
<p>The practice of hypergamy is, or was until recently, common among Br&#257;hmans. This is the rule by which the social estimation
of a family is raised if its girls are married into a class of higher social status than its own. Members of the superior
classes will take daughters from the lower classes on payment usually of a substantial bride-price, but will not give their
daughters to them. According to Manu, men of the higher castes were allowed to take wives from the lower ones but not to give
daughters to them. The origin of the custom is obscure. If caste was based on distinctions of race, then apparently the practice
of hypergamy would be objectionable, because it would destroy the different racial classes. If, on the other hand, the castes
consisted of groups of varying social status, the distinction being that those of the lower ones could not participate in
the sacramental or communal meals of the higher ones, then the marriage of a daughter into a higher group, which would carry
with it participation at the sacramental marriage <a id="d0e9792"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9792">364</a>]</span>feast of this group, might well be a coveted distinction. The custom of hypergamy prevails somewhat largely in northern India
between different subcastes, groups of different social status in the same subcaste, and occasionally even between different
castes. The social results of hypergamy, when commonly practised, are highly injurious. Men of the higher subcastes get paid
for marrying several wives, and indulge in polygamy, while the girls of the higher subcastes and the boys of the lower ones
find it difficult and sometimes even impossible to obtain husbands and wives. The custom attained its most absurd development
among the Kulin Br&#257;hmans of eastern Bengal, as described by Sir H. Risley.<a id="d0e9794src" href="#d0e9794" class="noteref">12</a> Here the Br&#257;hmans were divided by a Hindu king, Ball&#257;l Sen, into two classes, the Kulin (of good family), who had observed
the entire nine counsels of perfection; and the Srotriya, who, though regular students of the Vedas, had lost sanctity by
intermarrying with families of inferior birth. The latter were further subdivided into three classes according to their degree
of social purity, and each higher class could take daughters from the next one or two lower ones. The doctrine known as Kula-gotra
was developed, whereby the reputation of a family depended on the character of the marriages made by its female members. In
describing the results of the system Sir H. Risley states: &#8220;The rush of competition for Kulin husbands on the part of the
inferior classes became acute. In order to dispose of the surplus of women in the higher groups polygamy was resorted to on
a very large scale: it was popular with the Kulins because it enabled them to make a handsome income by the accident of their
birth; and it was accepted by the parents of the girls concerned as offering the only means of complying with the requirements
of the Hindu religion. Tempted by a <i>p&#257;n</i> or premium, which often reached the sum of two thousand rupees, Sw&#257;bhava Kulins made light of their <i>kul</i> and its obligations, and married girls, whom they left after the ceremony to be taken care of by their parents. Matrimony
became a sort of profession, and the honour of marrying a girl to a Kulin is said to have been so highly valued in <a id="d0e9805"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9805">365</a>]</span>eastern Bengal that as soon as a boy was ten years old his friends began to discuss his matrimonial prospects, and before
he was twenty he had become the husband of many wives of ages varying from five to fifty.&#8221; The wives were commonly left at
home to be supported by their parents, and it is said that when a Kulin Br&#257;hman had a journey to make he usually tried to
put up for the night at the house of one of his fathers-in-law. All the marriages were recorded in the registers of the professional
Gh&#257;taks or marriage-brokers, and each party was supplied with an extract. On arrival at his father-in-law&#8217;s house the Kulin
would produce his extract showing the date on which his marriage took place; and the owner of the house, who was often unfamiliar
with the bridegroom&#8217;s identity, would compare it with his own extract. When they agreed he was taken in and put up for the
night, and enjoyed the society of his wife. The system thus entailed the greatest misery to large numbers of women, both those
who were married to husbands whom they scarcely ever saw, and those of the higher classes who got no husbands at all. It is
now rapidly falling into abeyance. Hypergamy is found in the Central Provinces among the subcastes of Kanaujia Br&#257;hmans. The
Sarwaria subcaste, which is the highest, takes daughters from Kanaujias and Jijhotias, and the Kanaujias take them from the
Jijhotias. These and other subcastes such as the Khed&#257;w&#257;ls are also often divided into two groups of different status, the
higher of which takes daughters from the lower. Usually the parents of the girl pay a liberal bridegroom-price in money or
ornaments. It has never, however, been carried to the same length here as in Bengal, and two, or in some cases three, wives
are the limit for a man of the higher classes. One division of Kanaujias is called the S&#257;tkul or seven families, and is the
highest. Other Kanaujias, who are known as Pachh&#257;dar, pay substantial sums for husbands for this group, and it is reported
that if such a marriage takes place and the bridegroom-price is not paid up, the husband will turn his wife out and send her
home to her father. Certain subcastes of Sun&#257;rs also have hypergamy and, as between different castes, it exists between the
D&#257;ngis and R&#257;jp&#363;ts, pure R&#257;jp&#363;ts being <a id="d0e9807"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9807">366</a>]</span>held willing to take daughters in marriage from the highest clans of D&#257;ngis.

<h3>11. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>A text of Manu prescribes:<a id="d0e9814src" href="#d0e9814" class="noteref">13</a> &#8220;If a young woman marry while she is pregnant, whether her pregnancy be known or unknown, the male child in her womb belongs
to the bridegroom and is called a son received with his bride.&#8221; But at present a Br&#257;hman girl who is known to be pregnant
will be wholly debarred from the sacrament of marriage. An invitation to a wedding is sent by means of grains of rice coloured
yellow with turmeric and placed in a brass bowl with areca-nuts over them. All the members of the caste or subcaste who eat
food with the host and are resident in the same town or close at hand are as a rule invited, and all relatives of the family
who reside at a distance. The head of the family goes himself to the residence of the guests and invites them with expressions
of humility to honour his home. Before the wedding the ancestors of the family and also the divine mothers are worshipped,
these latter consisting of the consorts of the principal gods. In front of the wedding procession are carried <i>kalashas</i> or earthen jars filled to the brim with water, and with green shoots and branches floating on the top. The <i>kalasha</i> is said to represent the universe and to contain the principal gods and divine mothers, while the waters in it are the seven
seas. All these are witnesses to the wedding. Among other ceremonies, presents of fruit, food, ornaments and jewellery are
exchanged between the parties, and these are called <i>choli-ka-bhar&#257;na</i> or filling the bride&#8217;s breast-cloth. The original object of giving these presents was thus, it would appear from the name,
to render the bride fertile. The father then gives his daughter away in a set form of speech. After reciting the exact moment
of time, the hour, the day, the minute according to solar and lunar reckoning, the year and the epoch, he proceeds: &#8220;In the
name of Vishnu (repeating the name three times), the supreme spirit, father and creator of the universe, and in furtherance
of his wish for the propagation of the human species, I (specifying his full name and section, etc.), in the company of my
married wife, do hereby offer the hand of my daughter&#8212;may she live <a id="d0e9826"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9826">367</a>]</span>long&#8212;full of all virtuous qualities, image of Lakshmi, wife of Vishnu, anxious of union in lawful wedlock, ornamented and
dressed, brought up and instructed according to the best of my means, by name (naming her and repeating the full description
of ancestors, class, etc.) in the solemn presence of the Br&#257;hmans, Gurus, fire and deities, to you&#8212;may you live long&#8212;(repeating
the bridegroom&#8217;s name and full description), anxious to obtain a wife with a view to secure the abode of bliss and eternal
happiness in the heaven of Brahma. Accept her with <i>kusha</i> grass, grains of rice, water and presents of money.&#8221; Afterwards the father asks the bridegroom never to disregard the feelings
and sentiments of his wife in matters of religion, social pleasures and the acquisition of money, and the bridegroom agrees.
The binding portion of the ceremony consists in walking seven times round the sacred post, and when the seventh round is completed
the marriage is irrevocable. Among the Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans the bridegroom is called Nawar Deo or the new god. During the five
days of the wedding he is considered to be a sort of king, and is put in the highest place, and everybody defers to him. They
make the bridegroom and bride name each other for a joke, as they are ashamed to do this, and will not untie their clothes
to let them bathe until they have done it. At all the feasts the bride and bridegroom are made to eat out of the same plate,
and they put pieces of food in each other&#8217;s mouth, which is supposed to produce affection between them. The wedding expenses
in an ordinary Kanaujia Br&#257;hman&#8217;s family, whose income is perhaps Rs. 20 to 40 a month, are estimated at Rs. 200 for the bridegroom&#8217;s
party and Rs. 175 for the bride&#8217;s, exclusive of any bride- or bridegroom-price. The bulk of the expenditure is on feasts to
the caste. The bride does not live with her husband until after she arrives at puberty, but it is thought desirable that she
should spend long visits with his family before this, in order that she may assimilate their customs and be trained by her
mother-in-law, according to the saying, &#8216;Tender branches are easily bent.&#8217; Among some Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans, when the bride arrives
at puberty a ceremony called Garhbhad&#257;n is performed, and the husband confesses whether he has cohabited with his wife <a id="d0e9831"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9831">368</a>]</span>before her puberty, and if so, he is fined a small sum. Such instances usually occur when the signs of puberty are delayed.
If the planet Mangal or Mars is adverse to a girl in her horoscope, it is thought that her husband will die. The women of
her family will, therefore, first marry her secretly to a p&#299;pal-tree, so that the tree may die instead. But they do not tell
this to the bridegroom. In Saugor, girls whose horoscope is unfavourable to the husband are first married to the <i>arka</i> or swallow-wort plant. If a Br&#257;hman has not sufficient funds to arrange for the marriage of his daughter he will go about
and beg, and it is considered that alms given for this purpose acquire special merit for the donor, nor will any good Br&#257;hman
refuse a contribution according to his means.

<div class="div2" id="d0e9836">
<h3>12. Polygamy, divorce and treatment of widows.</h3>
<p>Polygamy conveys no stigma among Br&#257;hmans, but is uncommon. Divorce is not recognised, a woman who is put away by her husband
being turned out of the caste. The remarriage of widows is strictly prohibited. It is said that marriage is the only sacrament
(Sansk&#257;r) for a woman, and she can only go through it once. The holy nuptial texts may not be repeated except for a virgin.
The prohibition of the remarriage of widows has become a most firmly rooted prejudice among the higher classes of Hindus,
and is the last to give way before the inroads of liberal reform. Only a small minority of the most advanced Br&#257;hmans have
recognised widow-remarriage, and these are generally held to be excluded from the caste, though breaches of the rules against
the consumption of prohibited kinds of meat, and the drinking of aerated waters and even alcoholic liquor, are now winked
at and not visited with the proper penalty. Nevertheless, many classes of Br&#257;hmans, who live in the country and have taken
to cultivation, allow widows to live with men without putting the family out of caste. Where this is not permitted, surreptitious
intercourse may occasionally take place with members of the family. The treatment of widows is also becoming more humane.
Only Mar&#257;tha and Khedaw&#257;l Br&#257;hmans in the Central Provinces still force them to shave their heads, and these will permit a
child-widow to retain her hair until she grows up, though they regard her as impure while she has it. A widow is usually <a id="d0e9841"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9841">369</a>]</span>forbidden to have a cot or bed, and must sleep on the ground or on a plank. She may not chew betel-leaves, should eat only
once a day, and must rigorously observe all the prescribed fasts. She wears white clothes only, no glass bangles, and no ornaments
on her feet. She is subject to other restrictions and is a general drudge in the family. It is probable that the original
reason for such treatment of a widow was that she was considered impure through being perpetually haunted by her husband&#8217;s
ghost. Hindus say that a widow is half-dead. She should not be allowed to cook the household food, because while cooking it
she will remember her husband and the food will become like a corpse. The smell of such food will offend the gods, and it
cannot be offered to them. A widow is not permitted to worship the household god or the ancestors of the family. It was no
doubt an advantage under the joint family system that a widow should not claim any life-interest in her husband&#8217;s property.
The modern tendency of widows, who are left in possession, to try and alienate the property from the husband&#8217;s relatives has
been a fruitful cause of litigation and the ruin of many old landed families. The severe treatment of widows was further calculated
to suppress any tendency on the part of wives to poison their husbands. These secondary grounds may have contributed something
to the preservation and enforcement of an idea based originally on superstitious motives.

<div class="div2" id="d0e9843">
<h3>13. <i>Sati</i> or burning of widows.
</h3>
<p>For a widow to remain single and lead an austere and joyless life was held to confer great honour on her family; and this
was enormously enhanced when she decided to become <i>sati</i> and die with her husband on the funeral pyre. Though it is doubtful whether this practice is advocated by the Vedas, subsequent
Hindu scriptures insist strongly on it. It was said that a widow who was burnt with her husband would enjoy as many years
in paradise as there are hairs on the human head, that is to say, thirty-five million. Conversely, one who insisted on surviving
him would in her next birth go into the body of some animal. By the act of <i>sati</i> she purified all her husband&#8217;s ancestors, even from the guilt of killing a Br&#257;hman, and also those of her own family. If
a man died during an absence from home in another <a id="d0e9857"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9857">370</a>]</span>country his wife was recommended to take his slippers or any other article of dress and burn herself with them tied to her
breast.<a id="d0e9859src" href="#d0e9859" class="noteref">14</a>

</p>
<p>Great honour was paid to a Sati, and a temple or memorial stone was always erected to her at which her spirit was venerated,
and this encouraged many pious women not only to resign themselves to this terrible death but ardently to desire it. The following
account given by Mr. Ward of the method of a <i>sati</i> immolation in Bengal may be reproduced:<a id="d0e9870src" href="#d0e9870" class="noteref">15</a>

</p>
<p>&#8220;When the husband&#8217;s life is despaired of and he is carried to the bank of the Ganges, the wife declares her resolution to
be burnt with him. In this case she is treated with great respect by her neighbours, who bring her delicate food, and when
her husband is dead she again declares her resolve to be burnt with his body. Having broken a small branch from a mango tree
she takes it with her and proceeds to the body, where she sits down. The barber then paints the sides of her feet red, after
which she bathes and puts on new clothes. During these preparations the drum beats a certain sound by which it is known that
a widow is about to be burnt with the corpse of her husband. A hole is dug in the ground round which posts are driven into
the earth, and thick green stakes laid across to form a kind of bed; and upon these are laid in abundance dry faggots, hemp,
clarified butter and pitch. The officiating Br&#257;hman now causes the widow to repeat the prayer that as long as fourteen Indras
reign, or as many years as there are hairs on her head, she may abide in heaven with her husband; that during this time the
heavenly dancers may wait on her and her husband; and that by this act of merit all the ancestors of her mother and husband
may ascend to heaven. She now presents her ornaments to her friends, ties some red cotton on both wrists, puts two new combs
in her hair, paints her forehead, and takes into the end of the cloth that she wears some parched rice and cowries. The dead
body is bathed, anointed with butter, and dressed in new clothes. The son takes a handful of boiled rice and offers it in
the name of his deceased father. Ropes and another piece of <a id="d0e9877"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9877">371</a>]</span>cloth are spread on the wood, and the dead body is laid upon the pile. The widow next walks round the pyre seven times, as
she did round the marriage-post at her wedding, strewing parched rice and cowries as she goes, which the spectators catch
and keep under the belief that they will cure diseases. The widow then lies down on the fatal pile by the side of the dead
body. The bodies are bound together with ropes and the faggots placed over them. The son, averting his head, puts fire to
the face of his father, and at the same moment several persons light the pile at different sides, when the women and mourners
set up cries. More faggots are hastily brought and thrown over the pile, and two bamboo levers are pressed over them to hold
down the bodies and the pile. Several persons are employed in holding down these levers. More clarified butter, pitch and
faggots are thrown on to the pile till the bodies are consumed. This may take about two hours, but I conceive the woman must
be dead in a few minutes after the fire has been kindled.&#8221;

<p>As showing the tenacity with which women sometimes adhered to their resolve to be burned with their husbands, and thus, as
they believed, resume their conjugal life in heaven, the following account by Sir William Sleeman, in his <i>Rambles and Recollections</i>, of a <i>sati</i> at Jubbulpore may be given:

</p>
<p>&#8220;At Gop&#257;lpur on the Nerbudda are some very pretty temples built for the most part to the memory of women who have burned themselves
with the remains of their husbands, and on the very spot where the cremation occurred. Among them was one recently raised
over the ashes of one of the most extraordinary old bodies I had ever seen, who burned herself in my presence in 1829. In
March 1828 I had issued a proclamation prohibiting any one from aiding or assisting in <i>sati</i>, and distinctly stating that to bring one ounce of wood for the purpose would be considered as so doing. Subsequently, on
Tuesday, 24th November, I had an application from the heads of the most respectable and most extensive family of Br&#257;hmans
in the District, to suffer this old woman to burn herself with the remains of her husband, Umeid Singh Up&#257;dhya, who had that
morning died upon the banks of the Nerbudda. I threatened to <a id="d0e9892"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9892">372</a>]</span>enforce my order and punish severely any man who assisted; and placed a police guard for the purpose of seeing that no one
did so. The old woman remained by the edge of the water without eating or drinking. Next day the body of her husband was burned
in the presence of several thousand spectators, who had assembled to see the <i>sati</i>. The sons and grandsons of the old woman remained with her, urging her to desist from her resolve, while her other relatives
surrounded my house urging me to allow her to burn. All the day she remained sitting upon a bare rock in the bed of the Nerbudda,
refusing every kind of sustenance, and exposed to the intense heat of the sun by day and the severe cold of the night, with
only a thin sheet thrown over her shoulders. On the next day, Thursday, to cut off all hope of her being moved from her purpose,
she put on the <i>dhujja</i> or coarse red turban and broke her bracelets in pieces, by which she became dead in law and for ever excluded from caste.
Should she choose to live after this she could never return to her family. On the morning of Saturday, the fourth day after
the death, I rode out ten miles to the spot, and found the poor old widow sitting with the <i>dhujja</i> round her head, a brass plate before her with undressed rice and flowers, and a cocoanut in each hand. She talked very collectedly,
telling me that she had determined to mix her ashes with those of her departed husband, and should patiently await my permission
to do so, assured that God would enable her to sustain life till that was given, though she dared not eat or drink. Looking
at the sun, then rising before her over a long and beautiful reach of the Nerbudda, she said calmly: &#8216;My soul has been for
five days with my husband&#8217;s near that sun; nothing but my earthly frame is left, and this I know you will in time suffer to
be mixed with the ashes of his in yonder pit, because it is not in your nature wantonly to prolong the miseries of a poor
old woman.&#8217; I told her that my object and duty was to save and preserve her; I was come to urge her to live and keep her family
from the disgrace of being thought her murderers. I tried to work upon her pride and fears. I told her that the rent-free
lands on which her family had long subsisted might be resumed by Government if her children permitted her to do <a id="d0e9903"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9903">373</a>]</span>this act; and that no brick or stone should ever mark the place of her death; but if she would live, a splendid habitation
should be made for her among the temples, and an allowance given her from the rent-free lands. She smiled, but held out her
arm and said, &#8216;My pulse has long ceased to beat, for my spirit has departed, and I have nothing left but a little earth that
I wish to mix with the ashes of my husband. I shall suffer nothing in burning, and if you wish proof order some fire, and
you shall see this arm consumed without giving me any pain.&#8217; I did not attempt to feel her pulse, but some of my people did,
and declared that it had ceased to be perceptible. At this time every native present believed that she was incapable of suffering
pain, and her end confirmed them in their opinion. Satisfied myself that it would be unavailing to attempt to save her life,
I sent for all the principal members of the family, and consented that she should be suffered to burn herself if they would
enter into engagements that no other member of their family should ever do the same. This they all agreed to, and the papers
having been drawn out in due form about midday, I sent down notice to the old lady, who seemed extremely pleased and thankful.
The ceremonies of bathing were gone through before three, while the wood and other combustible materials for a strong fire
were collected and put into the pit. After bathing she called for a <i>p&#257;n</i> (betel-leaf) and ate it, then rose up, and with one arm on the shoulder of her eldest son, and the other on that of her nephew,
approached the fire. As she rose up fire was set to the pile, and it was instantly in a blaze. The distance was about one
hundred and fifty yards; she came on with a calm and cheerful countenance, stopped once, and casting her eyes upwards said,
&#8216;Why have they kept me five days from thee, my husband?&#8217; On coming to the sentries her supports stopped, she walked round
the pit, paused a moment; and while muttering a prayer threw some flowers into the fire. She then walked deliberately and
steadily to the brink, stepped into the centre of the flame, sat down, and leaning back in the midst as if reposing upon a
couch, was consumed without uttering a shriek or betraying one sign of agony.&#8221;

</p>
<p>In cases, however, where women shrank from the flames <a id="d0e9910"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9910">374</a>]</span>they were frequently forced into them, as it was a terrible disgrace to their families that they should recoil on the scene
of the sacrifice. Opium and other drugs were also administered to stupefy the woman and prevent her from feeling pain. Widows
were sometimes buried alive with their dead husbands. The practice of <i>sati</i> was finally prohibited in 1829, without exciting the least discontent.

<h3>14. Funeral rites and mourning.</h3>
<p>The bodies of children dying before they are named, or before the tonsure ceremony is performed on them, are buried, and those
of other persons are burnt. In the grave of a small child some of its mother&#8217;s milk, or, if this is not available, cow&#8217;s milk
in a leaf-cup or earthen vessel, is placed. Before a body is burnt cakes of wheat-flour are put on the face, breast and both
shoulders, and a coin is always deposited for the purchase of the site. Mourning or impurity is observed for varying periods,
according to the nearness of relationship. For a child, relatives other than the parents have only to take a bath to remove
the impurity caused by the death. In a small town or village all Br&#257;hmans of the same subcaste living in the place are impure
from the time of the death until cremation has taken place. After the funeral the chief mourner performs the <i>shr&#257;ddh</i> ceremony, offering <i>pindas</i> or cakes of rice, with libations of water, to the dead. Presents are made to Br&#257;hmans for the use of the dead man in the
other world, and these are sometimes very valuable, as it is thought that the spirit will thereby be profited. Such presents
are taken by the Mah&#257;-Br&#257;hman, who is much despised. When a late zam&#299;nd&#257;r of Khari&#257;r died, Rs. 2000 were given to the Mah&#257;-Br&#257;hman
for the use of his soul in the next world. The funeral rites are performed by an ordinary Br&#257;hman, known as Malai, who may
receive presents after the period of impurity has expired. Formerly a calf was let loose in the name of the deceased after
being branded with the mark of a trident to dedicate it to Siva, and allowed to wander free thenceforth. Sometimes it was
formally married to three or four female calves, and these latter were presented to Br&#257;hmans. Sometimes the calf was brought
to stand over the dying man and water poured down its tail into his mouth. The practice of letting loose a male calf is now
declining, as these animals <a id="d0e9926"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9926">375</a>]</span>are a great nuisance to the crops, and cultivators put them in the pound. The calf is therefore also presented to a Br&#257;hman.
It is believed that the <i>shr&#257;ddh</i> ceremony is necessary to unite the dead man&#8217;s spirit with the Pitris or ancestors, and without this it wanders homeless.
Some think that the ancestors dwell on the under or dark side of the moon. Those descendants who can offer the <i>pindas</i> or funeral cakes to the same ancestor are called Sapindas or relatives, and the man who fills the office of chief mourner
thereby becomes the dead man&#8217;s heir. Persons who have died a violent death or have been executed are not entitled to the ordinary
funeral oblations, and cannot at once be united with the ancestors. But one year after the death an effigy of the deceased
person is made in <i>kusha</i> grass and burnt, with all the ordinary funeral rites, and offerings are made to his spirit as if he had died on this occasion.
If the death was caused by snake-bite a gold snake is made and presented to a Br&#257;hman before this ceremony is begun. This
is held to be the proper funeral ceremony which unites his spirit with the ancestors. Formerly in Madras if a man died during
the last five days of the waning of the moon it was considered very unlucky. In order to escape evil effects to the relatives
a special opening was made in the wall of the house, through which the body was carried, and the house itself was afterwards
abandoned for three to six months.<a id="d0e9937src" href="#d0e9937" class="noteref">16</a> A similar superstition prevails in the Central Provinces about a man dying in the Mul Nakshatra or lunar asterism, which
is perhaps the same or some similar period. In this case it is thought that the deaths of four other members of the household
are portended, and to avert this four human figures are made of flour or grass and burnt with the corpse. According to the
Abb&eacute; Dubois if a man died on a Saturday it was thought that another death would occur in the family, and to avert this a living
animal, such as a ram, goat or fowl, was offered with the corpse.<a id="d0e9942src" href="#d0e9942" class="noteref">17</a>

<div class="div2" id="d0e9947">
<h3>15. Religion.</h3>
<p>The religion of the Br&#257;hmans is Hinduism, of which they are the priests and exponents. Formerly the Br&#257;hman considered himself
as a part of Brahma, and hence a god. <a id="d0e9952"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9952">376</a>]</span>This belief has decayed, but the gods are still held to reside in the body; Siva in the crown of the head, Vishnu in the chest,
Brahma in the navel, Indra in the genitals and Ganesh in the rectum. Most Br&#257;hmans belong to a sect worshipping especially
Siva or Vishnu, or R&#257;ma and Krishna, the incarnations of the latter god, or Sakti, the female principle of energy of Siva.
But as a rule Br&#257;hmans, whether of the Sivite or Vishnuite sects, abstain from flesh meat and are averse to the killing of
any living thing. The following account of the daily ritual prayers of a Ben&#257;res Br&#257;hman may be reproduced from M. Andr&eacute; Chevrillon&#8217;s
<i>Romantic India</i>,<a id="d0e9957src" href="#d0e9957" class="noteref">18</a> as, though possibly not altogether accurate in points of detail, it gives an excellent idea of their infinitely complicated
nature:

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e9960">
<h3>16. Daily ritual.</h3>
<p>&#8220;Here is the daily life of one of the twenty-five thousand Br&#257;hmans of Ben&#257;res. He rises before the dawn, and his first care
is to look at an object of good omen. If he sees a crow at his left, a kite, a snake, a cat, a hare, a jackal, an empty jar,
a smoking fire, a wood-pile, a widow, a man blind of one eye, he is threatened with great dangers during the day. If he intended
to make a journey, he puts it off. But if he sees a cow, a horse, an elephant, a parrot, a lizard, a clear-burning fire, a
virgin, all will go well. If he should sneeze once, he may count upon some special good fortune; but if twice some disaster
will happen to him. If he yawns some demon may enter his body. Having avoided all objects of evil omen, the Br&#257;hman drops
into the endless routine of his religious rites. Under penalty of rendering all the day&#8217;s acts worthless, he must wash his
teeth at the bank of a sacred stream or lake, reciting a special <i>mantra</i>, which ends in this ascription: &#8216;O Ganges, daughter of Vishnu, thou springest from Vishnu&#8217;s foot, thou art beloved by him!
Remove from us the stains of sin and birth, and until death protect us thy servants!&#8217; He then rubs his body with ashes, saying:
&#8216;Homage to Siva, homage to the source of all birth! May he protect me during all births!&#8217; He traces the sacred signs upon
his forehead&#8212;the three vertical lines representing the foot of Vishnu, or the three horizontal lines which symbolise the <a id="d0e9968"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9968">377</a>]</span>trident of Siva&#8212;and twists into a knot the hair left by the razor on the top of his head, that no impurity may fall from it
to pollute the sacred river.

</p>
<p>&#8220;He is now ready to begin the ceremonies of the morning (<i>sandhya</i>), those which I have just observed on the banks of the river. Minutely and mechanically each Br&#257;hman performs by himself
these rites of prescribed acts and gestures. First the internal ablution: the worshipper takes water in the hollow of his
hand, and, letting it fall from above into his mouth, cleanses his body and soul. Meanwhile he mentally invokes the names
of Vishnu, saying, &#8216;Glory to Keshava, to Nar&#257;yana, to M&#257;dhava, to Govinda,&#8217; and so on.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The second rite is the exercise or &#8216;discipline&#8217; of the respiration (<i>prajayama</i>). Here there are three acts: first, the worshipper compresses the right nostril with the thumb, and drives the breath through
the left; second, he inhales through the left nostril, then compresses it, and inhales through the other; third, he stops
the nose completely with thumb and forefinger, and holds his breath as long as possible. All these acts must be done before
sunrise, and prepare for what is to follow. Standing on the water&#8217;s edge, he utters solemnly the famous syllable OM, pronouncing
it <i>aum</i>, with a length equalling that of three letters. It recalls to him the three persons of the Hindu trinity: Brahma, who creates;
Vishnu, who preserves; Siva, who destroys. More noble than any other word, imperishable, says Manu, it is eternal as Brahma
himself. It is not a sign, but a being, a force; a force which constrains the gods, superior to them, the very essence of
all things. Mysterious operations of the mind, strange associations of ideas, from which spring conceptions like these! Having
uttered this ancient and formidable syllable, the man calls by their names the three worlds: earth, air, sky; and the four
superior heavens. He then turns towards the east, and repeats the verse<a id="d0e9983src" href="#d0e9983" class="noteref">19</a> from the Rig-Veda: &#8216;Let us meditate upon the resplendent glory of the divine vivifier, that it may enlighten our minds.&#8217;
As he says the last words he takes water in the palm of his hand and pours it upon the top of his head. &#8216;Waters,&#8217; he says,
<a id="d0e9986"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e9986">378</a>]</span>&#8216;give me strength and vigour that I may rejoice. Like loving mothers, bless us, penetrate us with your sacred essence. We
come to wash ourselves from the pollution of sins: make us fruitful and prosperous.&#8217; Then follow other ablutions, other <i>mantras</i>, verses from the Rig-Veda, and this hymn, which relates the origin of all things: &#8216;From the burning heat came out all things.
Yes, the complete order of the world; Night, the throbbing Ocean, and after the throbbing Ocean, Time, which separates Light
from Darkness. All mortals are its subjects. It is this which disposes of all things, and has made, one after another, the
sun, the sky, the earth, the intermediate air.&#8217; This hymn, says Manu, thrice repeated, effaces the gravest sins.

</p>
<p>&#8220;About this time, beyond the sands of the opposite shore of the Ganges, the sun appears. As soon as its brilliant disc becomes
visible the multitude welcome it, and salute it with &#8216;the offering of water.&#8217; This is thrown into the air, either from a vase
or from the hand. Thrice the worshipper, standing in the river up to his waist, flings the water towards the sun. The farther
and wider he flings it, the greater the virtue attributed to this act. Then the Br&#257;hman, seated upon his heels, fulfils the
most sacred of his religious duties: he meditates upon his fingers. For the fingers are sacred, inhabited by different manifestations
of Vishnu; the thumb by Govinda, the index-finger by M&#257;dhava, the middle finger by Hrikesa, the third by Trivikama and the
little finger by Vishnu himself. &#8216;Homage to the two thumbs,&#8217; says the Br&#257;hman, &#8216;to the two index-fingers, to the two middle
fingers, to the two &#8220;unnamed fingers,&#8221; to the two little fingers, to the two palms, to the two backs of the hands.&#8217; Then he
touches the various parts of the body, and lastly, the right ear, the most sacred of all, where reside fire, water, the sun
and the moon. He then takes a red bag (<i>gomukhi</i>), into which he plunges his hand, and by contortions of the fingers rapidly represents the chief incarnations of Vishnu:
a fish, a tortoise, a wild boar, a lion, a slip-knot, a garland.<a id="d0e9996src" href="#d0e9996" class="noteref">20</a>

</p>
<p>&#8220;The second part of the service is no less rich than the first in ablutions and <i>mantras</i>. The Br&#257;hman invokes the <a id="d0e10004"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10004">379</a>]</span>sun, &#8216;Mitra, who regards all creatures with unchanging gaze,&#8217; and the Dawns, &#8216;brilliant children of the sky,&#8217; the earliest
divinities of our Aryan race. He extols the world of Brahma, that of Siva, that of Vishnu; recites passages from the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,
the Pur&#257;nas, all the first hymn of the Rig-Veda, the first lines of the second, the first words of the principal Vedas, of
the Yajur, the Sama, and the Atharva, then fragments of grammar, inspired prosodies, and, in conclusion, the first words of
the book of the Laws of Yajnavalkya, the philosophic Sutras: and finally ends the ceremony with three kinds of ablutions,
which are called the refreshing of the gods, of the sages and of the ancestors.

</p>
<p>&#8220;First, placing his sacred cord upon the left shoulder, the Br&#257;hman takes up water in the right hand, and lets it run off
his extended fingers. To refresh the sages, the cord must hang about the neck, and the water run over the side of the hand
between the thumb and the forefinger, which is bent back. For the ancestors, the cord passes over the right shoulder, and
the water falls from the hand in the same way as for the sages. &#8216;Let the fathers be refreshed,&#8217; says the prayer, &#8216;may this
water serve all those who inhabit the seven worlds, as far as to Brahma&#8217;s dwelling, even though their number be greater than
thousands of millions of families. May this water, consecrated by my cord, be accepted by the men of my race who have left
no sons.&#8217;

</p>
<p>&#8220;With this prayer the morning service ends. Now, remember that this worship is daily, that these formulas must be pronounced,
these movements of the hands made with mechanical precision; that if the worshipper forgets one of the incarnations of Vishnu
which he is to figure with his fingers, if he stop his left nostril when it should be the right, the entire ceremony loses
its efficacy; that, not to go astray amid this multitude of words and gestures required for each rite, he is obliged to use
mnemotechnic methods; that there are five of these for each series of formulas; that his attention always strained and always
directed toward the externals of the cult, does not leave his mind a moment in which to reflect upon the profound meaning
of some of these prayers, and you will comprehend the extraordinary scene that the banks of the Ganges at Ben&#257;res present
every morning; <a id="d0e10010"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10010">380</a>]</span>this anxious and demented multitude, these gestures, eager and yet methodical, this rapid movement of the lips, the fixed
gaze of these men and women who, standing in the water, seem not even to see their neighbours, and count mentally like men
in the delirium of a fever. Remember that there are ceremonies like these in the afternoon and also in the evening, and that
in the intervals, in the street, in the house at meals, when going to bed, similar rites no less minute pursue the Br&#257;hman,
all preceded by the exercises of respiration, the enunciation of the syllable OM, and the invocation of the principal gods.
It is estimated that between daybreak and noon he has scarcely an hour of rest from the performance of these rites. After
the great powers of nature, the Ganges, the Dawn, and the Sun, he goes to worship in their temples the representations of
divinity, the sacred trees, finally the cows, to whom he offers flowers. In his own dwelling other divinities await him, five
black stones,<a id="d0e10012src" href="#d0e10012" class="noteref">21</a> representing Siva, Ganesa, Surya, Devi and Vishnu, arranged according to the cardinal points: one towards the north, a second
to the south-east, a third to the south-west, a fourth to the north-west, and one in the centre, this order changing according
as the worshipper regards one god or another as most important; then there is a shell, a bell&#8212;to which, kneeling, he offers
flowers&#8212;and, lastly, a vase, whose mouth contains Vishnu, the neck Rudra, the paunch Brahma, while at the bottom repose the
three divine mothers, the Ganges, the Indus, and the Jumna.

</div><p>


</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the daily cult of the Br&#257;hman of Ben&#257;res, and on holidays it is still further complicated. Since the great epoch
of Br&#257;hmanism it has remained the same. Some details may alter, but as a whole it has always been thus tyrannical and thus
extravagant. As far back as the Upanishads appears the same faith in the power of articulate speech, the same imperative and
innumerable prescriptions, the same singular formulas, the same enumeration of grotesque <a id="d0e10021"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10021">381</a>]</span>gestures. Every day, for more than twenty-five hundred years, since Buddhism was a protest against the tyranny and absurdity
of rites, has this race mechanically passed through this machinery, resulting in what mental malformations, what habitual
attitudes of mind and will, the race is now too different from ourselves for us to be able to conceive.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Secular Br&#257;hmans now, however, greatly abridge the length of their prayers, and an hour or an hour and a half in the morning
suffices for the daily bath and purification, the worship of the household deities and the morning meal.

<div class="div2" id="d0e10025">
<h3>17. The sacred thread.</h3>
<p>Br&#257;hman boys are invested with the sacred thread between the ages of five and nine. The ceremony is called Upanayana or the
introduction to knowledge, since by it the boy acquires the right to read the sacred books. Until this ceremony he is not
really a Br&#257;hman, and is not bound to observe the caste rules and restrictions. By its performance he becomes Dvija or twice-born,
and the highest importance is attached to the change or initiation. He may then begin to acquire divine knowledge, and perhaps
in past times it was thought that he obtained the divine character belonging to a Br&#257;hman. The sacred thread is made of three
strands of cotton, which should be obtained from the cotton tree growing wild. Sometimes a tree is grown in the yard of the
house for the provision of the threads. It has several knots in it, to which great importance is attached, the number of knots
being different for a Br&#257;hman, a Kshatriya and a Vaishya, the three twice-born castes. The thread hangs from the left shoulder,
falling on to the right hip. Sometimes, when a man is married, he wears a double thread of six strands, the second being for
his wife; and after his father dies a treble one of nine strands. At the investiture the boy&#8217;s nails are cut and his hair
is shaved, and he performs the <i>hom</i> or fire sacrifice for the first time. He then acquires the status of a Brahmachari or disciple, and in former times he would
proceed to some religious centre and begin to study the sacred books. The idea of this is preserved by a symbolic ritual.
Some Br&#257;hmans shave the boy&#8217;s head completely, make a girdle of <i>kusha</i> or <i>munj</i> grass round his waist, provide him with a begging-bowl and tongs and the skin of an antelope to sit on and make him go and
beg <a id="d0e10039"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10039">382</a>]</span>from four houses. Among others the boy gets on to a wooden horse and announces his intention of going off to Ben&#257;res to study.
His mother then sits on the edge of a well and threatens to throw herself in if he will not change his mind, or the maternal
uncle promises to give the boy his daughter in marriage. Then the boy relinquishes his intention and agrees to stay at home.
The sacred thread must always be passed through the hand before saying the Gayatri text in praise of the sun, the most sacred
Br&#257;hmanical text. The sacred thread is changed once a year on the day of Rakshabandhan; the Br&#257;hman and all his family change
it together. The word Rakshabandhan means binding or tying up the devils, and it would thus appear that the sacred thread
and the knots in it may have been originally intended to some extent to be a protection against evil spirits. It is also changed
on the occasion of a birth or death in the family, or of an eclipse, or if it breaks. The old threads are torn up or sewn
into clothes by the very poor in the Mar&#257;tha districts. It is said that the Br&#257;hmans are afraid that the Kunbis will get hold
of their old threads, and if they do get one they will fold it into four strings, holding a lamp in the middle, and wave it
over any one who is sick. The Br&#257;hmans think that if this is done all the accumulated virtue which they have obtained by many
repetitions of the Gayatri or sacred prayer will be transferred to the sick Kunbi. Many castes now wear the sacred thread
who have no proper claim to do so, especially those who have become landholders and aspire to the status of R&#257;jp&#363;ts.

<div class="div2" id="d0e10041">
<h3>18. Social position.</h3>
<p>The Br&#257;hman is of course supreme in Hindu society. He never bows his head in salutation to any one who is not a Br&#257;hman, and
acknowledges with a benediction the greetings of all other classes. No member of another caste, Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya states, can,
consistently with Hindu etiquette and religious beliefs, refuse altogether to bow to a Br&#257;hman. &#8220;The more orthodox S&#363;dras
carry their veneration for the priestly caste to such an extent that they will not cross the shadow of a Br&#257;hman, and it is
not unusual for them to be under a vow not to eat any food in the morning before drinking Br&#257;hman nectar,<a id="d0e10046src" href="#d0e10046" class="noteref">22</a> or water in which the toe of a <a id="d0e10050"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10050">383</a>]</span>Br&#257;hman has been dipped. On the other hand, the pride of the Br&#257;hman is such that he does not bow even to the images of the
gods in a S&#363;dra&#8217;s house. When a Br&#257;hman invites a S&#363;dra the latter is usually asked to partake of the host&#8217;s <i>pras&#257;da</i> or favour in the shape of the leavings of his plate. Orthodox S&#363;dras actually take offence if invited by the use of any other
formula. No S&#363;dra is allowed to eat in the same room or at the same time with Br&#257;hmans.&#8221;<a id="d0e10055src" href="#d0e10055" class="noteref">23</a>

</p>
<p>A man of low caste meeting a Br&#257;hman says &#8216;Pailagi&#8217; or &#8216;I fall at your feet,&#8217; and touches the Br&#257;hman&#8217;s foot with his hand,
which he then carries to his own forehead to signify this. A man wishing to ask a favour in a humble manner stands on one
leg and folds his cloth round his neck to show that his head is at his benefactor&#8217;s disposal; and he takes a piece of grass
in his mouth by which he means to say, &#8216;I am your cow.&#8217; Br&#257;hmans greeting each other clasp the hands and say &#8216;Salaam,&#8217; this
method of greeting being known as Namaskar. Since most Br&#257;hmans have abandoned the priestly calling and are engaged in Government
service and the professions, this exaggerated display of reverence is tending to disappear, nor do the educated members of
the caste set any great store by it, preferring the social estimation attaching to such a prominent secular position as they
often attain for themselves.

<h3>19. Titles.</h3>
<p>Any Br&#257;hman is, however, commonly addressed by other castes as Mah&#257;r&#257;j, great king, or else as Pandit, a learned man. I had
a Br&#257;hman chupr&#257;ssie, or orderly, who was regularly addressed by the rest of the household as Pandit, and on inquiring as
to the literary attainments of this learned man, I found he had read the first two class-books in a primary school. Other
titles of Br&#257;hmans are Dvija, or twice-born, that is, one who has had the thread ceremony performed; Bipra, applied to a Br&#257;hman
learned in the Sh&#257;stras or scriptures; and Srotriya, a learned Br&#257;hman who is engaged in the performance of Vedic rites.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10067">
<h3>20. Caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> and offences.
</h3>
<p>The Br&#257;hmans have a caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i>, but among the educated classes the tendency is to drop the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> procedure and to refer matters of caste rules and etiquette to the informal decision of a few of the most respected local
<a id="d0e10081"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10081">384</a>]</span>members. In northern India there is no supreme authority for the caste, but the five southern divisions acknowledge the successor
of the great reformer Shankar Ach&#257;rya as their spiritual head, and important caste questions are referred to him. His headquarters
are at the monastery of Sringeri on the Cauvery river in Mysore. Mr. Joshi gives four offences as punishable with permanent
exclusion from caste: killing a Br&#257;hman, drinking prohibited wine or spirits, committing incest with a mother or step-mother
or with the wife of one&#8217;s spiritual preceptor, and stealing gold from a priest. Some very important offences, therefore, such
as murder of any person other than a Br&#257;hman, adultery with a woman of impure caste and taking food from her, and all offences
against property, except those mentioned, do not involve permanent expulsion. Temporary exclusion is inflicted for a variety
of offences, among which are teaching the Vedas for hire, receiving gifts from a S&#363;dra for performing fire-worship, falsely
accusing a spiritual preceptor, subsisting by the harlotry of a wife, and defiling a damsel. It is possible that some of the
offences against morality are comparatively recent additions. Br&#257;hmans who cross the sea to be educated in England are readmitted
into caste on going through various rites of purification; the principal of these is to swallow the five products of the sacred
cow, milk, <i>gh&#299;</i> or preserved butter, curds, dung and urine. But the small minority who have introduced widow-marriage are still banned by
the orthodox.

<h3>21. Rules about food.</h3>
<p>Br&#257;hmans as a rule should not eat meat nor drink intoxicating liquor. But it is said that the following indulgences have been
recognised: for residents in eastern India the eating of flesh and drinking liquor; for those of northern India the eating
of flesh; for those in the west the use of water out of leather buckets; and in the south marriage with a first cousin on
the mother&#8217;s side. Hindust&#257;ni Br&#257;hmans eat meat, according to Mr. Joshi, and others are now also adopting this custom. The
kinds of meat permitted are mutton and venison, scaly, but not scaleless, fish, hares, and even the tortoise, wild boar, wild
buffalo and rhinoceros. Br&#257;hmans are said even to eat domestic fowls, though not openly, and wild jungle <a id="d0e10095"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10095">385</a>]</span>fowls are preferred, but are seldom obtainable. Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans will not eat meat openly. Formerly only the flesh of animals
offered in sacrifice could be eaten, but this rule is being disregarded and some Br&#257;hmans buy mutton from the butchers. A
Br&#257;hman should not eat even <i>pakki rasoi</i> or food cooked without water, such as sweetmeats and cakes fried in butter or oil, except when cooked by his own family and
in his own home. But these are now partaken of abroad, and also purchased from the Halwai or confectioner on the assumption
that he is a Br&#257;hman. A Br&#257;hman should take food cooked with water only from his own relations and in his own home after the
place has been purified and spread with cowdung. He bathes before eating, and wears only a yellow silk or woollen cloth round
his waist, which is kept specially for this purpose, cotton being regarded as impure. But these rules are tending to become
obsolete, as educated Br&#257;hmans recognise more and more what a hindrance they cause to any social enjoyment. Boys especially
who receive an English education in high schools and universities are rapidly becoming more liberal. They will drink soda-water
or lemonade of which they are very fond, and eat European sweets and sometimes biscuits. The social intercourse of boys of
all castes and religions in school and games, and in the latter the frequent association with Europeans, are having a remarkable
effect in breaking down caste prejudice, the results of which should become very apparent in a few years. A Br&#257;hman also should
not smoke, but many now do so, and when they go to see a friend will take their own huqqa with them as they cannot smoke out
of his. Mar&#257;tha and Khedaw&#257;l Br&#257;hmans, however, as a rule do not smoke, but only chew tobacco.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10100">
<h3>22. Dress.</h3>
<p>A Br&#257;hman&#8217;s dress should be white, and he can have a coloured turban, preferably red. Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans were very particular
about the securing of their <i>dhoti</i> or loin-cloth, which always had to have five tucks, three into the waistband at the two sides and in front, while the loose
ends were tucked in in front and behind. Buttons had to be avoided as they were made of bone, and shoes were considered to
be impure as being of leather. Formerly a <a id="d0e10108"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10108">386</a>]</span>Br&#257;hman never entered a house with his shoes on, as he would consider the house to be defiled. According to the old rule,
if a Br&#257;hman touches a man of an impure caste, as a Cham&#257;r (tanner) or Basor (basket-maker), he should bathe and change his
loin-cloth, and if he touches a sweeper he should change his sacred thread. Now, however, educated Br&#257;hmans usually wear white
cotton trousers and black or brown coats of cloth, alpaca or silk with the normal allowance of buttons, and European shoes
and boots which they keep on indoors. Boys are even discarding the <i>choti</i> or scalp-lock and simply cut their hair short in imitation of the English. For the head small felt caps have become fashionable
in lieu of turbans.

<div class="div2" id="d0e10113">
<h3>23. Tattooing.</h3>
<p>Men are never tattooed, but women are freely tattooed on the face and body. One dot is made in the centre of the forehead
and three on the left nostril in the form of a triangle. All the limbs and the fingers and toes may also be tattooed, the
most common patterns being a peacock with spread wings, a fish, cuckoo, scorpion, a child&#8217;s doll, a sieve, a pattern of S&#299;ta&#8217;s
cookroom and representations of all female ornaments. Some women think that they will be able to sell the ornaments tattooed
on their bodies in the next world and subsist on the proceeds.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10118">
<h3>24. Occupation.</h3>
<p>In former times the Br&#257;hman was supposed to confine himself to priestly duties, learning the Vedas and giving instruction
to the laity. His subsistence was to be obtained from gleaning the fields after the crop had been cut and from unsolicited
alms, as it was disgraceful for him to beg. But if he could not make a living in this manner he was at liberty to adopt a
trade or profession. The majority of Br&#257;hmans have followed the latter course with much success. They were the ministers of
Hindu kings, and as these were usually illiterate, most of the power fell into the Br&#257;hmans&#8217; hands. In Poona the Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans
became the actual rulers of the State. They have profited much from gifts and bequests of land for charitable purposes and
are one of the largest landholding castes. In Mew&#257;r it was recorded that a fifth of the State revenue from land was assigned
in religious grants,<a id="d0e10123src" href="#d0e10123" class="noteref">24</a> and in the deeds of gift, drawn <a id="d0e10128"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10128">387</a>]</span>up no doubt by the Br&#257;hmans themselves, the most terrible penalties were invoked on any one who should interfere with the
grant. One of these was that such an impious person would be a caterpillar in hell for sixty thousand years.<a id="d0e10130src" href="#d0e10130" class="noteref">25</a> Plots of land and mango groves are also frequently given to Br&#257;hmans by village proprietors. A Br&#257;hman is forbidden to touch
the plough with his own hands, but this rule is falling into abeyance and many Br&#257;hman cultivators plough themselves. Br&#257;hmans
are also prohibited from selling a large number of articles, as milk, butter, cows, salt and so on. Formerly a Br&#257;hman village
proprietor refused payment for the supplies of milk and butter given to travellers, and some would expend the whole produce
of their cattle in feeding religious mendicants and poor Br&#257;hmans. But these scruples, which tended to multiply the number
of beggars indefinitely, have happily vanished, and Br&#257;hmans will even sell cows to a butcher. Mr. Joshi relates that a suit
was brought by a Br&#257;hman in his court for the hide of a cow sold by him for slaughter. A number of Br&#257;hmans are employed as
personal servants, and these are usually cooks, a Br&#257;hman cook being very useful, since all Hindus can eat the food which
he prepares. Nor has this calling hitherto been considered derogatory, as food is held to be sacred, and he who prepares it
is respected. Many live on charitable contributions, and it is a rule among Hindus that a Br&#257;hman coming into the house and
asking for a present must be given something or his curse will ruin the family. Liberality is encouraged by the recitation
of legends, such as that of the good king Harischandra who gave away his whole kingdom to the great Br&#257;hman saint Visvamitra,
and retired to Ben&#257;res with a loin-cloth which the recipient allowed him to retain from his possessions. But Br&#257;hmans who
take gifts at the time of a death, and those who take them from pilgrims at the sacred shrines, are despised and considered
as out of caste, though not the priests in charge of temples. The rapacity of all these classes is proverbial, and an instance
may be given of the conduct of the Pandas or temple-priests of Ben&#257;res. These men were so haughty that they never appeared
in the temple unless <a id="d0e10135"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10135">388</a>]</span>some very important visitor was expected, who would be able to pay largely. It is related that when the ex-Peshwa of Poona
came to Ben&#257;res after the death of his father he solicited the Panda of the great temple of Viseshwar to assist him in the
performance of the ceremonies necessary for the repose of his father&#8217;s soul. But the priest refused to do so until the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja
had filled with coined silver the <i>hauz</i> or font of the temple. The demand was acceded to and Rs. 125,000 were required to fill the font.<a id="d0e10140src" href="#d0e10140" class="noteref">26</a> Those who are very poor adopt the profession of a Mah&#257;-Br&#257;hman or Mah&#257;p&#257;tra, who takes gifts for the dead. Respectable Br&#257;hmans
will not accept gifts at all, but when asked to a feast the host usually gives them one to four annas or pence with betel-leaf
at the time of their departure, and there is no shame in accepting this. A very rich man may give a gold mohar (guinea) to
each Br&#257;hman. Other Br&#257;hmans act as astrologers and foretell events. They pretend to be able to produce rain in a drought
or stop excessive rainfall when it is injuring the crops. They interpret dreams and omens. In the case of a theft the loser
will go to a Br&#257;hman astrologer, and after learning the circumstances the latter will tell him what sort of person stole the
property and in what direction the property is concealed. But the large majority of Br&#257;hmans have abandoned all priestly functions,
and are employed in all grades of Government service, the professions and agriculture. In 1911 about fifty-three per cent
of Br&#257;hmans in the Central Provinces were supported by agriculture as landowners, cultivators and labourers. About twenty-two
per cent were engaged in the arts and professions, seven per cent in Government service, including the police which contains
many Br&#257;hman constables, and only nineteen per cent were returned under all occupations connected with religion.

<h3>25. Character of Br&#257;hmans.</h3>
<p>Many hard things have been said about the Br&#257;hman caste and have not been undeserved. The Br&#257;hman priesthood displayed in
a marked degree the vices of arrogance, greed, hypocrisy and dissimulation, which would naturally be engendered by their sacerdotal
pretensions and the position they claimed at the head of Hindu society. But the priests <a id="d0e10148"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10148">389</a>]</span>and mendicants now, as has been seen, contribute only a comparatively small minority of the whole caste. The majority of the
Br&#257;hmans are lawyers, doctors, executive officers of Government and clerks in all kinds of Government, railway and private
offices. The defects ascribed to the priesthood apply to these, if at all, only in a very minor degree. The Br&#257;hman official
has many virtues. He is, as a rule, honest, industrious and anxious to do his work creditably. He spends very little on his
own pleasures, and his chief aim in life is to give his children as good an education as he can afford. A half or more of
his income may be devoted to this object. If he is well-to-do he helps his poor relations liberally, having the strong fellow-feeling
for them which is a relic of the joint family system. He is a faithful husband and an affectionate father. If his outlook
on life is narrow and much of his leisure often devoted to petty quarrels and intrigues, this is largely the result of his
imperfect, parrot-like education and lack of opportunity for anything better. In this respect it may be anticipated that the
excellent education and training now afforded by Government in secondary schools for very small fees will produce a great
improvement; and that the next generation of educated Hindus will be considerably more manly and intelligent, and it may be
hoped at the same time not less honest, industrious and loyal than their fathers.

rank a little below the Kanaujias proper and the Sarwarias, who are also a branch of the Kanaujia division. The two latter
classes take daughters in marriage from Jijhotias, but do not give their daughters to them. But these hypergamous marriages
are now rare. Jijhotia Br&#257;hmans will plough with their own hands in Saugor.

<p><b>Br&#257;hman, Kanaujia, Kanyakubja.</b>&#8212;This, the most important division of the northern Br&#257;hmans, takes its name from the ancient city of Kanauj in the Farukh&#257;b&#257;d
District on the Ganges, which was on two occasions the capital of India. The great king Harsha Vardhana, who ruled the whole
of northern India in the seventh century, had his headquarters here, and when the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang stayed at Kanauj
in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 638 and 643 he found upwards of a hundred monasteries crowded by more than 10,000 Buddhist monks. &#8220;Hinduism flourished as
well as Buddhism, and could show more than two hundred temples with thousands of worshippers. The city, which was strongly
fortified, extended along the east bank of the Ganges for about four miles, and was adorned with lovely gardens and clear
tanks. The inhabitants were well-to-do, including some families of great wealth; they dressed in silk, and were skilled in
learning and the arts.&#8221;<a id="d0e10185src" href="#d0e10185" class="noteref">1</a> When Mahm&#363;d of Ghazni appeared before Kanauj in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1018 the number of temples is said to have risen to 10,000. The Sultan destroyed the temples, but seems to have spared the
city. Thereafter Kanauj declined in importance, though still the capital of a R&#257;jp&#363;t dynasty, and the final sack by Shih&#257;b-ud-D&#299;n
in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1194 reduced it to desolation and insignificance for ever.<a id="d0e10196src" href="#d0e10196" class="noteref">2</a>

</p>
<p>The Kanaujia Br&#257;hmans include the principal body of the caste in Bengal and in the Hindi Districts of the Central Provinces.
They are here divided into four sub-groups, the Kanaujia proper, Sarwaria, Jijhotia and San&#257;dhya, which are separately noticed.
The Sarwarias are sometimes considered to rank a little higher than the proper Kanaujias. It is said that the two classes
are the <a id="d0e10203"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10203">391</a>]</span>descendants of two brothers, Kanya and Kubja, of whom the former accepted a present from the divine king R&#257;ma of Ayodhya when
he celebrated a sacrifice on his return from Ceylon, while the latter refused it. The Sarwarias are descended from Kubja who
refused the present and therefore are purer than the Kanaujias, whose ancestor, Kanya, accepted it. Kanya and Kubja are simply
the two parts of Kanyakubja, the old name for Kanauj. It may be noted that Kanya means a maiden and also the constellation
Virgo, while Kubja is a name of the planet Mars; but it is not known whether the words in this sense are connected with the
name of the city. The Kanaujia Br&#257;hmans of the Central Provinces practise hypergamy, as described in the general article on
Br&#257;hman. Mr. Crooke states that in the United Provinces the children of a man&#8217;s second wife can intermarry with those of his
first wife, provided that they are not otherwise related or of the same section. The practice of exchanging girls between
families is also permitted there.<a id="d0e10205src" href="#d0e10205" class="noteref">3</a> In the Central Provinces the Kanaujias eat meat and sometimes plough with their own hands. The Chhatt&#299;sgarhi Kanaujias form
a separate group, who have been long separated from their brethren elsewhere. As a consequence other Kanaujias will neither
eat nor intermarry with them. Similarly in Saugor those who have come recently from the United Provinces will not marry with
the older settlers. A Kanaujia Br&#257;hman is very strict in the matter of taking food, and will scarcely eat it unless cooked
by his own relations, according to the saying, &#8216;<i lang="und">Ath Kanaujia, nau chulha</i>&#8217; or &#8216;Eight Kanaujias will want nine places to cook their food.&#8217;

</span><h2>Br&#257;hman, Khed&#257;w&#257;l</h2>
<p><b>Br&#257;hman, Khed&#257;w&#257;l.</b>&#8212;The Khed&#257;w&#257;ls are a class of Gujar&#257;ti Br&#257;hmans, who take their name from Kheda or Kaira, the headquarters of the Kaira District,
where they principally reside. They have two divisions, known as Inside and Outside. It is said that once the Kaira chief
was anxious to have a son and offered them gifts. The majority refused the gifts, and leaving Kaira settled in villages outside
the town; while a small number accepted the gifts and <a id="d0e10220"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10220">392</a>]</span>remained inside, and hence two separate divisions arose, the outside group being the higher.<a id="d0e10222src" href="#d0e10222" class="noteref">1</a> It is said that the first Khed&#257;w&#257;l who came to the Central Provinces was on a journey from Gujar&#257;t to Ben&#257;res when, on passing
through Panna State, he saw some diamonds lying in a field. He stopped and picked up as many as he could and presented them
to the R&#257;ja of Panna, who made him a grant of an estate, and from this time other Khed&#257;w&#257;ls came and settled. A considerable
colony of them now exists in Saugor and Damoh. The Khed&#257;w&#257;ls are clever and astute, and many of them are the agents of landowners
and moneylenders, while a large proportion are in the service of the Government. They do not as a rule perform priestly functions
in the Central Provinces. Their caste observances are strict. Formerly it is said that a Khed&#257;w&#257;l who was sent to jail was
permanently expelled from caste, and though the rule has been relaxed the penalties for readmission are still very heavy.
They do not smoke, but only chew tobacco. Widows must dress in white, and their heads are sometimes shaved. They are said
to consider a camel as impure as a donkey, and will not touch either animal. One of their common titles is Mehta, meaning
great. The Khed&#257;w&#257;ls of the Central Provinces formerly married only among themselves, but since the railway has been opened
intermarriage with their caste-fellows in Gujar&#257;t has been resumed.

</span><h2>Br&#257;hman, Mah&#257;r&#257;shtra</h2>
<p><b>Br&#257;hman, Mah&#257;r&#257;shtra, Mar&#257;tha.</b>&#8212;The Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans, or those of the Bombay country, are numerous and important in the Central Provinces. The northern Districts
were for a period governed by Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans on behalf of the Peshwa of Poona, and under the Bhonsla dynasty of N&#257;gpur in
the south they took a large part in the administration. The Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans have three main subcastes, the Deshasth, Konkonasth
and Karh&#257;da. The Deshasth Br&#257;hmans belong to the country of Poona above the Western Ghats, which is known as the <i>desh</i> or home country. They are numerous in Ber&#257;r and N&#257;gpur. The Konkonasth are so called because they reside in the Konkan country
along the Bombay coast. They have noticeably fair complexions, <a id="d0e10241"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10241">393</a>]</span>good features and often grey eyes. According to a legend they were sprung from the corpses of a party of shipwrecked foreigners,
who were raised to life by Parasur&#257;ma.<a id="d0e10243src" href="#d0e10243" class="noteref">1</a> This story and their fine appearance have given rise to the hypothesis that their ancestors were shipwrecked sailors from
some European country, or from Arabia or Persia. They are also known as Chitp&#257;van, which is said to mean the pure in heart,
but a derivation suggested in the <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i> is from Chiplun or Chit&#257;polan, a place in the Konkan which was their headquarters. The Peshwa of Poona was a Konkonasth Br&#257;hman,
and there are a number of them in Saugor. The Karh&#257;da Br&#257;hmans take their name from the town of Karh&#257;d in the Sat&#257;ra District.
They show little difference from the Deshasths in customs and appearance.

</p>
<p>Formerly the above three subcastes were endogamous and married only among themselves. But since the railway has been opened
they have begun to intermarry with each other to a limited extent, having obtained sanction to this from the successor of
Shankar Ach&#257;rya, whom they acknowledge as their spiritual head.

</p>
<p>The Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans are also divided into sects, according to the Veda which they follow. Most of them are either Rigvedis
or Yajurvedis, and these two sects marry among themselves. These Br&#257;hmans are strict in the observance of caste rules. They
do not take water from any but other Br&#257;hmans, and abstain from flesh and liquor. They will, however, eat with any of the
P&#257;nch-Dr&#257;vid or southern divisions of Br&#257;hmans except those of Gujar&#257;t. They usually abstain from smoking, and until recently
have made widows shave their heads; but this rule is perhaps now relaxed. As a rule they are well educated, and the majority
of them look to Government service for a career, either as clerks in the public offices or as officers of the executive and
judicial services. They are intelligent and generally reliable workers. The full name of a Mar&#257;tha or Gujar&#257;ti Br&#257;hman consists
of his own name, his father&#8217;s name and a surname. But he is commonly addressed by his own name, followed by the honorific
termination Rao for R&#257;ja, a king, or Pant for Pandit, a wise man.

</span><h2>Br&#257;hman, Maithil</h2>
<p><b>Br&#257;hman, Maithil.</b>&#8212;One of the five P&#257;nch-Gaur or northern divisions, comprising the Br&#257;hmans of Bih&#257;r or Tirh&#363;t. There are some Maithil Br&#257;hman
families settled in Mandla, who were formerly in the service of the Gond kings. They have the surname of Ojha, which is one
of those borne by the caste and signifies a soothsayer. The Maithil Br&#257;hmans are said to have at one time practised magic.
Mithila or Bih&#257;r has also, from the earliest times, been famous for the cultivation of Sanskrit, and the great lawgiver Yajnavalkya
is described as a native of this country.<a id="d0e10263src" href="#d0e10263" class="noteref">1</a> The head of the subcaste is the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja of Darbhanga, to whom family disputes are sometimes referred for decision. The Maithil
Br&#257;hmans are said to be mainly Sakti worshippers. They eat flesh and fish, but do not drink liquor or smoke tobacco.<a id="d0e10269src" href="#d0e10269" class="noteref">2</a>

<p><b>Br&#257;hman, M&#257;lwi.</b>&#8212;This is a local class of Br&#257;hmans from M&#257;lwa in Central India, who are found in the Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d and Bet&#363;l Districts. They
are said to have been invited here by the Gond kings of Kherla in Bet&#363;l six or more centuries ago, and are probably of impure
descent. M&#257;lwa is north of the Nerbudda, and they should therefore properly belong to the P&#257;nch-Gaur division, but they speak
Mar&#257;thi and their customs resemble those of Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans, who will take food cooked without water from them. The M&#257;lwi
Br&#257;hmans usually belong to the Madhyandina branch of the Yajurvedi sect. They work as village accountants (<i>patw&#257;ris</i>) and village priests, and also cultivate land.

</span><h2>Br&#257;hman, N&#257;gar</h2>
<p><b>Br&#257;hman, N&#257;gar.</b>&#8212;A class of Gujar&#257;ti Br&#257;hmans found in the Nim&#257;r District. The name is said to be derived from the town of Vadnagar of Gujar&#257;t,
now in Baroda State. According to one account they accepted grants of land from a R&#257;jp&#363;t king, and hence were put out of caste
by their fellows. Another story is that the N&#257;gar Br&#257;hman women were renowned for their personal beauty and also for their
skill in music. The emperor Jah&#257;ngir, hearing of their fame, wished to see them and sent for them, but they refused <a id="d0e10291"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10291">395</a>]</span>to go. The emperor then ordered that all the men should be killed and the women be taken to his Court. A terrible struggle
ensued, and many women threw themselves into tanks and rivers and were drowned, rather than lose their modesty by appearing
before the emperor. A body of Br&#257;hmans numbering 7450 (or 74&frac12; hundred) threw away their sacred threads and became S&#363;dras in
order to save their lives. Since this occurrence the figure 74&frac12; is considered very unlucky. Banias write 74&frac12; in the beginning
of their account-books, by which they are held to take a vow that if they make a false entry in the book they will be guilty
of the sin of having killed this number of Br&#257;hmans. The same figure is also written on letters, so that none but the person
to whom they are addressed may dare to open them.<a id="d0e10293src" href="#d0e10293" class="noteref">1</a>

</p>
<p>The above stories seem to show that the N&#257;gar Br&#257;hmans are partly of impure descent. In Gujar&#257;t it is said that one section
of them called B&#257;rud are the descendants of N&#257;gar Br&#257;hman fathers who were unable to get wives in their own caste and took
them from others. The B&#257;rud section also formerly permitted the remarriage of widows.<a id="d0e10298src" href="#d0e10298" class="noteref">2</a> This seems a further indication of mixed descent. The N&#257;gars settled in the Central Provinces have for a long time ceased
to marry with those of Gujar&#257;t owing to difficulties in communication. But now that the railway has been opened they have
petitioned the Rao of Bhaunagar, who is the head of the caste, and a N&#257;gar Br&#257;hman, to introduce intermarriage again between
the two sections of the caste. Many N&#257;gar Br&#257;hmans have taken to secular occupations and are land-agents and cultivators.

</p>
<p>Formerly the N&#257;gar Br&#257;hmans observed very strict rules about defilement when in the state called <i>Nuven</i>, that is, having bathed and purified themselves prior to taking food. A Br&#257;hman in this condition was defiled if he touched
an earthen vessel unless it was quite new and had never held water. If he sat down on a piece of cotton cloth or a scrap of
leather or paper he became impure unless Hindu letters had been written on the paper; these, as being the goddess <a id="d0e10308"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10308">396</a>]</span>S&#257;raswati, would preserve it from defilement. But cloth or leather could not be purified through being written on. Thus if
the Br&#257;hman wished to read any book before or at his meal it had to be bound with silk and not with cotton; leather could
not be used, and instead of paste of flour and water the binder had to employ paste of pounded tamarind seed. A printed book
could not be read, because printing-ink contained impure matter. Raw cotton did not render the Br&#257;hman impure, but if it had
been twisted into the wick of a lamp by any one not in a state of purity he became impure. Bones defiled, but women&#8217;s ivory
armlets did not, except in those parts of the country where they were not usually worn, and then they did. The touch of a
child of the same caste who had not learned to eat grain did not defile, but if the child ate grain it did. The touch of a
donkey, a dog or a pig defiled; some said that the touch of a cat also defiled, but others were inclined to think it did not,
because in truth it was not easy to keep the cat out.<a id="d0e10310src" href="#d0e10310" class="noteref">3</a>

</p>
<p>If a Br&#257;hman was defiled and rendered impure by any of the above means he could not proceed with his meal.

</span><h2>Br&#257;hman, N&#257;ramdeo</h2>
<p><b>Br&#257;hman, N&#257;ramdeo.</b>&#8212;A class of Br&#257;hmans who live in the Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d and Nim&#257;r Districts near the banks of the Nerbudda, from which river their
name is derived. According to their own account they belong to the Gurjara or Gujar&#257;ti division, and were expelled from Gujar&#257;t
by a R&#257;ja who had cut up a golden cow and wished them to accept pieces of it as presents. This they refused to do on account
of the sin involved, and hence were exiled and came to the Central Provinces. A local legend about them is to the effect that
they are the descendants of a famous Rishi or saint, who dwelt beside the Nerbudda, and of a Naoda or Dh&#299;mar woman who was
one of his disciples. The N&#257;ramdeo Br&#257;hmans have for the most part adopted secular occupations, though they act as village
priests or astrologers. They are largely employed as village accountants (<i>patw&#257;ris</i>), clerks in Government offices, and agents to landowners, that is, in very much the same capacity <a id="d0e10331"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10331">397</a>]</span>as the K&#257;yasths. As land-agents they show much astuteness, and are reputed to have enriched themselves in many cases at the
expense of their masters. Hence they are unpopular with the cultivators just as the K&#257;yasths are, and very uncomplimentary
proverbs are current about them.

</span><h2>Br&#257;hman, San&#257;dhya</h2>
<p><b>Br&#257;hman, San&#257;dhya, Sanaurhia.</b>&#8212;The San&#257;dhyas are considered in the Central Provinces to be a branch of the Kanaujia division. Their home is in the Ganges-Jumna
Do&#257;b and Rohilkhand, between the Gaur Br&#257;hmans to the north-west and the Kanaujias to the east. Mr. Crooke states that in
some localities the San&#257;dhyas intermarry with both the Kanaujia and Gaur divisions. But formerly both Kanaujias and Gaurs
practised hypergamy with the San&#257;dhyas, taking daughters from them in marriage but not giving their daughters to them.<a id="d0e10340src" href="#d0e10340" class="noteref">1</a> This fact indicates the inferiority of the San&#257;dhya group, but marriage is now becoming reciprocal. In Bengal the San&#257;dhyas
account for their inferiority to the other Kanaujias by saying that their ancestors on one occasion at the bidding of a R&#257;ja
partook of a sacrificial feast with all their clothes on, instead of only their loin-cloths according to the rule among Br&#257;hmans,
and were hence degraded. The San&#257;dhyas themselves have two divisions, the <i>S&#257;rhe-t&#299;n ghar</i> and <i>Dasghar</i>, or Three-and-a-half houses and Ten houses, of whom the former are superior, and practise hypergamy with the latter. Further,
it is said that the Three-and-a-half group were once made to intermarry with the degraded Kataha or Mah&#257;-Br&#257;hmans, who are
funeral priests.<a id="d0e10351src" href="#d0e10351" class="noteref">2</a> This further indicates the inferior status of the San&#257;dhyas. The Sanaurhia criminal caste of pickpockets are supposed to
be made up of a nucleus of San&#257;dhya Br&#257;hmans with recruits from all other castes, but this is not certain. In the Central
Provinces a number of San&#257;dhyas took to carrying grain and merchandise on pack-bullocks, and are hence known as Belw&#257;r. They
form a separate subcaste, ranking below the other San&#257;dhyas and marrying among themselves. Mr. Crooke notes that at their
weddings the San&#257;dhyas worship a potter&#8217;s wheel. Some make an image of it on the wall of the house, while <a id="d0e10357"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10357">398</a>]</span>others go to the potter&#8217;s house and worship his wheel there. In the Central Provinces after the wedding they get a bed newly
made with <i>new&#257;r</i> tape and seat the bride and bridegroom on it, and put a large plate at their feet, in which presents are placed. The San&#257;dhyas
differ from the Kanaujias in that they smoke tobacco but do not eat meat, while the Kanaujias eat meat but do not smoke. They
greet each other with the word Dand&#257;wat, adding Mah&#257;r&#257;j to an equal or superior.

<p><b>Br&#257;hman, Sarwaria.</b>&#8212;This is the highest class of the Kanaujia Br&#257;mans, who take their name from the river Sarju or Gogra in Oudh, where they
have their home. They observe strict rules of ceremonial purity, and do not smoke tobacco nor plough with their own hands.
An orthodox Sarwaria Br&#257;man will not give his daughter in marriage in a village from which his family has received a girl,
and sometimes will not even drink the water of that village. The Sarwarias make widows dress in white and sometimes shave
their heads. In some tracts they intermarry with the Kanaujia Br&#257;hmans, and in others take daughters in marriage but do not
give their own daughters to them. In Dr. Buchanan&#8217;s time, a century ago, the Sarwaria Br&#257;hmans would not eat rice sold in
the baz&#257;r which had been cleaned in boiling water, as they considered that it had thereby become food cooked with water; and
they carried their own grain to the grain-parcher to be prepared for them. When they ate either parched grain or sweetmeats
from a confectioner in public they must purify the place on which they sat down with cowdung and water.<a id="d0e10373src" href="#d0e10373" class="noteref">1</a> This may be compared with a practice observed by very strict Br&#257;hmans even now, of adding water to the medicine which they
obtain from a Government dispensary, to purify it before drinking it.

</span><h2>Br&#257;hman, Utkal</h2>
<p><b>Br&#257;hman, Utkal.</b>&#8212;These are the Br&#257;hmans of Orissa and one of the P&#257;nch-Gaur divisions. They are divided into two groups, the D&#257;kshinatya or
southern and the Jajpuria or northern clan. The Utkal Br&#257;hmans, who first settled in Sambalpur, are known as Jharia or jungly,
and form a <a id="d0e10385"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10385">399</a>]</span>separate subcaste, marrying among themselves, as the later immigrants refuse to intermarry with them. Another group of Orissa
Br&#257;hmans have taken to cultivation, and are known as Halia, from <i>hal</i>, a plough. They grow the betel-vine, and in Orissa the areca and cocoanuts, besides doing ordinary cultivation. They have
entirely lost their sacerdotal character, but glory in their occupation, and affect to despise the Bed or Veda Br&#257;hmans, who
live upon alms.<a id="d0e10390src" href="#d0e10390" class="noteref">1</a> A third class of Orissa Br&#257;hmans are the Pandas, who serve as priests and cooks in the public temples and also in private
houses, and travel about India touting for pilgrims to visit the temple at Jagann&#257;th. Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya describes the procedure
of the temple-touts as follows:<a id="d0e10402src" href="#d0e10402" class="noteref">2</a>

</p>
<p>&#8220;Their tours are so organised that during their campaigning season, which commences in November and is finished by the car-festival
at the beginning of the rains, very few villages of the adjoining Provinces escape their visits and taxation. Their appearance
causes a disturbance in every household. Those who have already visited &#8216;The Lord of the World&#8217; at Puri are called upon to
pay an instalment towards the debt contracted by them while at the sacred shrine, which, though paid many times over, is never
completely satisfied. That, however, is a small matter compared with the misery and distraction caused by the &#8216;Jagann&#257;th mania,&#8217;
which is excited by the preachings and pictures of the Panda. A fresh batch of old ladies become determined to visit the shrine,
and neither the waitings and protestations of the children nor the prospect of a long and toilsome journey can dissuade them.
The arrangements of the family are for the time being altogether upset, and the grief of those left behind is heightened by
the fact that they look upon the pilgrims as going to meet almost certain death....&#8221;

</p>
<p>This vivid statement of the objections to the habit of pilgrimage from a Br&#257;hman writer is very interesting. Since the opening
of the railway to Puri the danger and expense as well as the period of absence have been greatly reduced; but the pilgrimages
are still responsible for a large <a id="d0e10411"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10411">400</a>]</span>mortality, as cholera frequently breaks out among the vast assembly at the temple, and the pilgrims, hastily returning to
all parts of India, carry the disease with them, and cause epidemics in many localities. All castes now eat the rice cooked
at the temple of Jagann&#257;th together without defilement, and friendships are cemented by eating a little of this rice together
as a sacred bond.

</span><h2>Chad&#257;r</h2>
<p><b>Chad&#257;r,<a id="d0e10419src" href="#d0e10419" class="noteref">1</a> Kotwar.</b>&#8212;A small caste of weavers and village watchmen resident in the Districts of Saugor, Damoh, Jubbulpore and Narsinghpur. They
numbered 28,000 persons in 1911. The caste is not found outside the northern Districts of the Central Provinces. The name
is derived from the Sanskrit <i>chirkar</i>, a weaver, and belongs to Bundelkhand, but beyond this the Chad&#257;rs have no knowledge or traditions of their origin. They
are probably an occupational group formed from members of the Dravidian tribes and others who took to the profession of village
watchmen. A number of other occupational castes of low status are found in the northern Districts, and their existence is
probably to be accounted for by the fact that the forest tribes were subjected and their tribal organisation destroyed by
the invading Bundelas and other Hindus some centuries ago. They were deprived of the land and relegated to the performance
of menial and servile duties in the village, and they have formed a new set of divisions into castes arising from the occupations
they adopted. The Chad&#257;rs have two subcastes based on differences of religious practice, the Parmesuria or worshippers of
Vishnu, and Athia or devotees of Devi. It is doubtful, however, whether these are strictly endogamous. They have a large number
of exogamous septs or <i>bainks</i>, which are named after all sorts of animals, plants and natural objects. Instances of these names are Dh&#257;na (a leaf of the
rice plant), K&#257;sia (bell-metal), Gohia (a kind of lizard), Bachhulia (a calf), Gujaria (a milkmaid), Moria (a peacock), Laraiya
(a jackal), Khatk&#299;ra (a bug), Sugaria (a pig), Barraiya (a wasp), Neora (a mongoose), Bhartu Chiraiya (a sparrow), and so
on. Thirty-nine names <a id="d0e10429"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10429">401</a>]</span>in all are reported. Members of each sept draw the figure of the animal or plant after which it is named on the wall at marriages
and worship it. They usually refuse to kill the totem animal, and the members of the Sugaria or pig sept throw away their
earthen vessels if a pig should be killed in their sight, and clean their houses as if on the death of a member of the family.
Marriage between members of the same sept is forbidden and also between first cousins and other near relations. The Chad&#257;rs
say that the marriages of persons nearly related by blood are unhappy, and occasion serious consequences to the parties and
their families. Girls are usually wedded in the fifth, seventh, ninth, or eleventh year of their age and boys between the
ages of eight and sixteen. If an unmarried girl is seduced by a member of the caste she is married to him by the simple form
adopted for the wedding of a widow. But if she goes wrong with an outsider of low caste she is permanently expelled. The remarriage
of widows is permitted and divorce is also allowed, a deed being executed on stamped paper before the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or caste committee. If a woman runs away from her husband to another man he must repay to the husband the amount expended
on her wedding and give a feast to the caste. A Br&#257;hman is employed to fix the date of a wedding and sometimes for the naming
of children, but he is only consulted and is never present at the ceremony. The caste venerate the goddess Devi, offering
her a virgin she-goat in the month of As&#257;rh (June-July). They worship their weaving implements at the Diw&#257;li and Holi festivals,
and feed the crows in Kunw&#257;r (September-October) as representing the spirits of their ancestors. This custom is based on the
superstition that a crow does not die of old age or disease, but only when it is killed. To cure a patient of fever they tie
a blue thread, irregularly knotted, round his wrist. They believe that thunder-bolts are the arrows shot by Indra to kill
his enemies in the lower world, and that the rainbow is Indra&#8217;s bow; any one pointing at it will feel pain in his finger.
The dead are mourned for ten days, and during that time a burning lamp is placed on the ground at some distance from the house,
while on the tenth day a tooth-stick and water and food are set out for the <a id="d0e10434"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10434">402</a>]</span>soul of the dead. They will not throw the first teeth of a child on to a tiled roof, because they believe that if this is
done his next teeth will be wide and ugly like the tiles. But it is a common practice to throw the first teeth on to the thatched
roof of the house. The Chad&#257;rs will admit members of most castes of good standing into the community, and they eat flesh,
including pork and fowls, and drink liquor, and will take cooked food from most of the good castes and from Kal&#257;rs, Khang&#257;rs
and Kumh&#257;rs. The social status of the caste is very low, but they rank above the impure castes and are of cleanly habits,
bathing daily and cleaning their kitchens before taking food. They are employed as village watchmen and as farmservants and
field-labourers, and also weave coarse country cloth.

<h3>1. General notice of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Cham&#257;r, Chambh&#257;r.</b><a id="d0e10534src" href="#d0e10534" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;The caste of tanners and menial labourers of northern India. In the Central Provinces the Cham&#257;rs numbered about 900,000
persons in 1911. They are the third caste in the Province in numerical strength, being exceeded by the Gonds and Kunbis. About
600,000 persons, or two-thirds of the total strength of the caste in the Province, belong to the Chhatt&#299;sgarh Division and
adjacent Feudatory States. Here the Cham&#257;rs have to some extent emancipated themselves from their servile status and have
become cultivators, and occasionally even m&#257;lguz&#257;rs or landed proprietors; and between them and <a id="d0e10546"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10546">404</a>]</span>the Hindus a bitter and long-standing feud is in progress. Outside Chhatt&#299;sgarh the Cham&#257;rs are found in most of the Hindi-speaking
Districts whose population has been recruited from northern and central India, and here they are perhaps the most debased
class of the community, consigned to the lowest of menial tasks, and their spirit broken by generations of servitude. In the
Mar&#257;tha country the place of the Cham&#257;rs is taken by the Mehras or Mah&#257;rs. In the whole of India the Cham&#257;rs are about eleven
millions strong, and are the largest caste with the exception of the Br&#257;hmans. The name is derived from the Sanskrit Charmak&#257;ra,
a worker in leather; and, according to classical tradition, the Cham&#257;r is the offspring of a Chand&#257;l or sweeper woman by a
man of the fisher caste.<a id="d0e10548src" href="#d0e10548" class="noteref">2</a> The superior physical type of the Cham&#257;r has been noticed in several localities. Thus in the Kanara District of Bombay<a id="d0e10551src" href="#d0e10551" class="noteref">3</a> the Cham&#257;r women are said to be famed for their beauty of face and figure, and there it is stated that the Padminis or perfect
type of women, middle-sized with fine features, black lustrous hair and eyes, full breasts and slim waists,<a id="d0e10556src" href="#d0e10556" class="noteref">4</a> are all Cham&#257;rins. Sir D. Ibbetson writes<a id="d0e10562src" href="#d0e10562" class="noteref">5</a> that their women are celebrated for beauty, and loss of caste is often attributed to too great a partiality for a Cham&#257;rin.
In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the Cham&#257;rs are generally of fine stature and fair complexion; some of them are lighter in colour than the
Chhatt&#299;sgarhi Br&#257;hmans, and it is on record that a European officer mistook a Cham&#257;r for a Eurasian and addressed him in English.
This, however, is by no means universally the case, and Sir H. Risley considers<a id="d0e10567src" href="#d0e10567" class="noteref">6</a> that &#8220;The average Cham&#257;r is hardly distinguishable in point of features, stature or complexion from the members of those
non-Aryan races from whose ranks we should primarily expect the profession of leather-dressers to be recruited.&#8221; Again, Sir
Henry Elliot, writing of the Cham&#257;rs of the North-Western Provinces, says: &#8220;Cham&#257;rs <a id="d0e10572"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10572">405</a>]</span>are reputed to be a dark race, and a fair Cham&#257;r is said to be as rare an object as a black Br&#257;hman:


</p>
<div class="poem" lang="und">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>Karia Br&#257;hman, gor Cham&#257;r,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Inke s&#257;th n&#257; utariye p&#257;r,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>that is, &#8216;Do not cross a river in the same boat with a black Br&#257;hman or a fair Cham&#257;r,&#8217; both being of evil omen.&#8221; The latter
description would certainly apply to the Cham&#257;rs of the Central Provinces outside the Chhatt&#299;sgarh Districts, but hardly to
the caste as a whole within that area. No satisfactory explanation has been offered of this distinction of appearance of some
groups of Cham&#257;rs. It is possible that the Cham&#257;rs of certain localities may be the descendants of a race from the north-west,
conquered and enslaved by a later wave of immigrants; or that their physical development may owe something to adult marriage
and a flesh diet, even though consisting largely of carrion. It may be noticed that the sweepers, who eat the broken food
from the tables of the Europeans and wealthy natives, are sometimes stronger and better built than the average Hindu. Similarly,
the Kasais or Muhammadan butchers are proverbially strong and lusty. But no evidence is forthcoming in support of such conjectures,
and the problem is likely to remain insoluble.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cham&#257;rs,&#8221; Sir H. Risley states,<a id="d0e10583src" href="#d0e10583" class="noteref">7</a> &#8220;trace their own pedigree to Ravi or Rai D&#257;s, the famous disciple of R&#257;m&#257;nand at the end of the fourteenth century, and whenever
a Cham&#257;r is asked what he is, he replies a Ravi D&#257;s. Another tradition current among them alleges that their original ancestor
was the youngest of four Br&#257;hman brethren who went to bathe in a river and found a cow struggling in a quicksand. They sent
the youngest brother in to rescue the animal, but before he could get to the spot it had been drowned. He was compelled, therefore,
by his brothers to remove the carcase, and after he had done this they turned him out of their caste and gave him the name
of Cham&#257;r.&#8221; Other legends are related by Mr. Crooke in his article on the caste.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10587">
<h3>2. Endogamous divisions.</h3>
<p>The Cham&#257;rs are broken up into a number of endogamous subcastes. Of these the largest now consists of the <a id="d0e10592"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10592">406</a>]</span>members of the Satn&#257;mi sect in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, who do not intermarry with other Cham&#257;rs. They are described in the article on
that sect. The other Cham&#257;rs call the Satn&#257;mis Jharia or &#8216;jungly&#8217;, which implies that they are the oldest residents in Chhatt&#299;sgarh.
The Satn&#257;mis are all cultivators, and have given up working in leather. The Chungias (from <i>chungi</i>, a leaf-pipe) are a branch of the Satn&#257;mis who have taken to smoking, a practice which is forbidden by the rules of the sect.
In Chhatt&#299;sgarh those Cham&#257;rs who still cure hides and work in leather belong either to the Kanaujia or Ahirw&#257;r subcastes,
the former of whom take their name from the well-known classical town of Kanauj in northern India, while the latter are said
to be the descendants of unions between Cham&#257;r fathers and Ah&#299;r mothers. The Kanaujias are much addicted to drink, and though
they eat pork they do not rear pigs. The Ahirw&#257;rs, or Erw&#257;rs as they are called outside Chhatt&#299;sgarh, occupy a somewhat higher
position than the Kanaujias. They consider themselves to be the direct descendants of the prophet Raid&#257;s or Rohid&#257;s, who,
they say, had seven wives of different castes; one of them was an Ah&#299;r woman, and her offspring were the ancestors of the
Ahirw&#257;r subcaste. Both the Kanaujias and Ahirw&#257;rs of Chhatt&#299;sgarh are generally known to outsiders as Paikaha, a term which
indicates that they still follow their ancestral calling of curing hides, as opposed to the Satn&#257;mis, who have generally eschewed
it. Those Cham&#257;rs who are curriers have, as a rule, the right to receive the hides of the village cattle in return for removing
the carcases, each family of Cham&#257;rs having allotted to them a certain number of tenants whose dead cattle they take, while
their women are the hereditary midwives of the village. Such Cham&#257;rs have the designation of Meher. The Kanaujias make shoes
out of a single piece of leather, while the Ahirw&#257;rs cut the front separately. The latter also ornament their shoes with fancy
work consisting of patterns of silver thread on red cloth. No Ahirw&#257;r girl is married until she has shown herself proficient
in this kind of needlework.<a id="d0e10597src" href="#d0e10597" class="noteref">8</a> Another well-known group, found both in Chhatt&#299;sgarh and elsewhere, are the Jaisw&#257;ras, who take their name from the <a id="d0e10600"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10600">407</a>]</span>old town of Jais in the United Provinces. Many of them serve as grooms, and are accustomed to state their caste as Jaisw&#257;ra,
considering it a more respectable designation than Cham&#257;r. The Jaisw&#257;ras must carry burdens on their heads only and not on
their shoulders, and they must not tie up a dog with a halter or neck-rope, this article being venerated by them as an implement
of their calling. A breach of either of these rules entails temporary excommunication from caste and a fine for readmission.
Among a number of territorial groups may be mentioned the Bundelkhandi or immigrants from Bundelkhand; the Bhadoria from the
Bhad&#257;war State; the Antarvedi from Antarved or the Do&#257;b, the country lying between the Ganges and Jumna; the Gang&#257;p&#257;ri or
those from the north of the Ganges; and the Pardeshi (foreigners) and Desha or Desw&#257;r (belonging to the country), both of
which groups come from Hindust&#257;n. The Desw&#257;r Cham&#257;rs of Narsinghpur<a id="d0e10602src" href="#d0e10602" class="noteref">9</a> are now all agriculturists and have totally abjured the business of working in leather. The Mahobia and Khaijr&#257;ha take their
names from the towns of Mahoba and Khaijra in Central India. The L&#257;dse or L&#257;dvi come from south Gujar&#257;t, which in classical
times was known as L&#257;t; while the Mar&#257;tha, Ber&#257;ria and Dakhini subdivisions belong to southern India. There are a number of
other territorial groups of less importance.

<div class="div2" id="d0e10607">
<h3>3. Subcastes continued.</h3>
<p>Certain subcastes are of an occupational nature, and among these may be mentioned the Budalgirs of Chhindw&#257;ra, who derive
their name from the <i>budla</i>, or leather bag made for the transport and storage of oil and <i>gh&#299;</i>. The <i>budla</i>, Mr. Trench remarks,<a id="d0e10621src" href="#d0e10621" class="noteref">10</a> has been ousted by the kerosene oil tin, and the industry of the Budalgirs has consequently almost disappeared; but the <i>budlas</i> are still used by barbers to hold oil for the torches which they carry in wedding processions. The Daijanya subcaste are
so named because their women act as midwives (<i>dai</i>), but this business is by no means confined to one particular group, being undertaken generally by Cham&#257;r women. The Kataua
or Katwa are leather-cutters, the name being derived from <i>k&#257;tna</i>, to cut. And the Gobardhua (from <i>gobar</i>, cowdung) collect the <a id="d0e10637"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10637">408</a>]</span>droppings of cattle on the threshing-floors and wash out and eat the undigested grain. The Mochis or shoemakers and J&#299;ngars<a id="d0e10639src" href="#d0e10639" class="noteref">11</a> or saddlemakers and bookbinders have obtained a better position than the ordinary Cham&#257;rs, and have now practically become
separate castes; while, on the other hand, the Dohar subcaste of Narsinghpur have sunk to the very lowest stage of casual
labour, grass-cutting and the like, and are looked down on by the rest of the caste.<a id="d0e10642src" href="#d0e10642" class="noteref">12</a> The Korcham&#257;rs are said to be the descendants of alliances between Cham&#257;rs and Koris or weavers, and the Turkanyas probably
have Turk or Musalm&#257;n blood in their veins. In Ber&#257;r the Romya or Haralya subcaste claim the highest rank and say that their
ancestor Harlya was the primeval Cham&#257;r who stripped off a piece of his own skin to make a pair of shoes for Mah&#257;deo.<a id="d0e10647src" href="#d0e10647" class="noteref">13</a> The M&#257;ngya<a id="d0e10652src" href="#d0e10652" class="noteref">14</a> Cham&#257;rs of Ch&#257;nda and the Nona Cham&#257;rs of Damoh are groups of beggars, who are the lowest of the caste and will take food
from the hands of any other Cham&#257;r. The Nona group take their name from Nona or Lona Cham&#257;rin, a well-known witch about whom
Mr. Crooke relates the following story:<a id="d0e10658src" href="#d0e10658" class="noteref">15</a> &#8220;Her legend tells how Dhanwantari, the physician of the gods, was bitten by Takshaka, the king of the snakes, and knowing
that death approached he ordered his sons to cook and eat his body after his death, so that they might thereby inherit his
skill in medicine. They accordingly cooked his body in a cauldron, and were about to eat it when Takshaka appeared to them
in the form of a Br&#257;hman and warned them against this act of cannibalism. So they let the cauldron float down the Ganges,
and as it floated down, Lona the Cham&#257;rin, who was washing on the bank of the river, took the vessel out in ignorance of its
contents, and partook of the ghastly food. She at once obtained power to cure diseases, and especially snake-bite. One day
all the women were transplanting rice, and it was found that Lona could do as much work as all her companions put together.
So they watched her, and when she thought she was alone she stripped off her clothes (nudity being an <a id="d0e10663"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10663">409</a>]</span>essential element in magic), muttered some spells, and threw the plants into the air, when they all settled down in their
proper places. Finding she was observed, she tried to escape, and as she ran the earth opened, and all the water of the rice-fields
followed her and thus was formed the channel of the Loni River in the Unao District.&#8221; This Lona or Nona has obtained the position
of a nursery bogey, and throughout Hindust&#257;n, Sir H. Risley states, parents frighten naughty children by telling them that
Nona Cham&#257;rin will carry them off. The Cham&#257;rs say that she was the mother or grandmother of the prophet Ravi D&#257;s, or Rai
D&#257;s already referred to.

<h3>4. Exogamous divisions.</h3>
<p>The caste is also divided into a large number of exogamous groups or sections, whose names, as might be expected, present
a great diversity of character. Some are borrowed from R&#257;jp&#363;t clans, as S&#363;rajvansi, Gaharw&#257;r and R&#257;thor; while others, as
Marai, are taken from the Gonds. Instances of sections named after other castes are Banjar (Banj&#257;ra), Jogi, Chhipia (Chhipi,
a tailor) and Khairw&#257;r (a forest tribe). The Chhipia section preserve the memory of their comparatively illustrious descent
by refusing to eat pork. Instances of sections called after a title or nickname of the reputed founder are M&#257;l&#257;dh&#257;ri, one
who wears a garland; M&#257;chhi-Mundia or fly-headed, perhaps the equivalent of feather-brained; Hath&#299;la, obstinate; B&#257;ghm&#257;r,
a tiger-killer; M&#257;ngaya, a beggar; Dhuliya, a drummer; Jadkodiha, one who digs for roots, and so on. There are numerous territorial
groups named after the town or village where the ancestor of the clan may be supposed to have lived; and many names also are
of a totemistic nature, being taken from plants, animals or natural objects. Among these are Khunti, a peg; Chandaniha, sandalwood;
Tarw&#257;ria, a sword; Borbans, plums; Miri, chillies; Chauria, a whisk; Baraiya, a wasp; Khalaria, a hide or skin; Kosni, <i>kosa</i> or tasar silk; and Purain, the lotus plant. Totemistic observances survive only in one or two isolated instances.

<h3>5. Marriage.</h3>
<p>A man must not take a wife from his own section, nor in some localities from that of his mother or either of his grandmothers.
Generally the union of first cousins is prohibited. Adult marriage is the rule, but those who wish to improve <a id="d0e10678"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10678">410</a>]</span>their social position have taken to disposing of their daughters at an early age. Matches are always arranged by the parents,
and it is the business of the boy&#8217;s father to find a bride for his son. A bride-price is paid which may vary from two pice
(farthings) to a hundred rupees, but usually averages about twenty rupees. In Ch&#257;nda the amount is fixed at Rs. 13 and it
is known as <i>hunda</i>, but if the bride&#8217;s grandmother is alive it is increased to Rs. 15&#8211;8, and the extra money is given to her. The marriage ceremony
follows the standard type prevalent in the locality. On his journey to the girl&#8217;s house the boy rides on a bullock and is
wrapped up in a blanket. In Bil&#257;spur a kind of sham fight takes place between the parties, which is a reminiscence of the
former practice of marriage by capture and is thus described as an eye-witness by the Rev. E. M. Gordon of Mungeli:<a id="d0e10683src" href="#d0e10683" class="noteref">16</a>

</p>
<p>&#8220;As the bridegroom&#8217;s party approached the home of the bride the boy&#8217;s friends lifted him up on their shoulders, and, surrounding
him on every side, they made their way to the bride&#8217;s house, swinging round their sticks in a threatening manner. On coming
near the house they crossed sticks with the bride&#8217;s friends, who gradually fell back and allowed the bridegroom&#8217;s friends
to advance in their direction. The women of the house gathered with baskets and fans and some threw about rice in pretence
of self-defence. When the sticks of the bridegroom&#8217;s party struck the roof of the bride&#8217;s house or of the marriage-shed her
friends considered themselves defeated and the sham fight was at an end.&#8221; Among the Mar&#257;tha Cham&#257;rs of Bet&#363;l two earthen pots
full of water are half buried in the ground and worship is paid to them. The bride and bridegroom then stand together and
their relatives take out water from the pots and pour it on to their heads from above. The idea is that the pouring of the
sacred water on to them will make them grow, and if the bride is much smaller than the bridegroom more water is poured on
to her in order that she may grow faster. The practice may symbolise the fertilising influence of rain. Among the Dohar Cham&#257;rs
of Narsinghpur the bride and bridegroom are seated on a plough-yoke while the marriage <a id="d0e10689"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10689">411</a>]</span>ceremony is performed. Before the wedding the bride&#8217;s party take a goat&#8217;s leg in a basket with other articles to the <i>janw&#257;sa</i> or bridegroom&#8217;s lodging and present it to his father. The bride and bridegroom take the goat&#8217;s leg and beat each other with
it alternately. Another ceremony, known as Pendp&#363;ja, consists in placing pieces of stick with cotton stuck to the ends in
an oven and burning them in the name of the deceased ancestors; but the significance, if there be any, of this rite is obscure.
Some time after the wedding the bride is taken to her husband&#8217;s house to live with him, and on this occasion a simple ceremony
known as Chauk or Pathoni is performed.

<h3>6. Widow-marriage and divorce.</h3>
<p>Widows commonly remarry, and may take for their second husband anybody they please, except their own relatives and their late
husband&#8217;s elder brother and ascendant relations. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh widows are known either as <i>barandi</i> or <i>randi</i>, the <i>randi</i> being a widow in the ordinary sense of the term and the <i>barandi</i> a girl who has been married but has not lived with her husband. Such a girl is not required to break her bangles on her husband&#8217;s
death, and, being more in demand as a second wife, her father naturally obtains a good price for her. To marry a woman whose
husband is alive is known as <i>chhandwe ban&#257;na</i>, the term <i>chhandwe</i> implying that the woman has discarded, or has been discarded by, her husband. The second husband must in this case repay
to the first husband the expenses incurred by him on his wedding. The marriage ceremony for a widow is of the simplest character,
and consists generally of the presentation to her by her new husband of those articles which a married woman may use, but
which should be forsworn by a widow, as representing the useless vanities of the world. Thus in Saugor the bridegroom presents
his bride with new clothes, vermilion for the parting of her hair, a spangle for her forehead, lac dye for her feet, antimony
for the eyes, a comb, glass bangles and betel-leaves. In Mandla and Seoni the bridegroom gives a ring, according to the English
custom, instead of bangles. When a widow marries a second time her first husband&#8217;s property remains with his family and also
the children, unless they are very young, when the mother may keep them for a few years and subsequently send them <a id="d0e10717"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10717">412</a>]</span>back to their father&#8217;s relatives. Divorce is permitted for a variety of causes, and is usually effected in the presence of
the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee by the husband and wife breaking a straw as a symbol of the rupture of the union. In Ch&#257;nda an image of the
divorced wife is made of grass and burnt to indicate that to her husband she is as good as dead; if she has children their
heads and faces are shaved in token of mourning, and in the absence of children the husband&#8217;s younger brother has this rite
performed; while the husband gives a funeral feast known as <i>Marti J&#299;ti k&#257; Bh&#257;t</i>, or &#8216;The feast of the living dead woman.&#8217; In Chhatt&#299;sgarh marriage ties are of the loosest description, and adultery is scarcely
recognised as an offence. A woman may go and live openly with other men and her husband will take her back afterwards. Sometimes,
when two men are in the relation of Mah&#257;pras&#257;d or nearest friend to each other, that is, when they have vowed friendship on
rice from the temple of Jagann&#257;th, they will each place his wife at the other&#8217;s disposal. The Cham&#257;rs justify this carelessness
of the fidelity of their wives by the saying, &#8216;If my cow wanders and comes home again, shall I not let her into her stall?&#8217;
In Seoni, if a Cham&#257;r woman is detected in a misdemeanour with a man of the caste, both parties are taken to the bank of a
tank or river, where their heads are shaved in the presence of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee. They are then made to bathe, and the shoes of all the assembled Cham&#257;rs made up into two bundles and placed
on their heads, while they are required to promise that they will not repeat the offence.

<div class="div2" id="d0e10728">
<h3>7. Funeral customs.</h3>
<p>The caste usually bury the dead with the feet to the north, like the Gonds and other aboriginal tribes. They say that heaven
is situated towards the north, and the dead man should be placed in a position to start for that direction. Another explanation
is that the head of the earth lies towards the north, and yet another that in the Satyug or beginning of time the sun rose
in the north; and in each succeeding Yug or era it has veered round the compass until now in the Kali Yug or Iron Age it rises
in the east. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh, before burying a corpse, they often make a mark on the body with butter, oil or soot; and when
a child is <a id="d0e10733"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10733">413</a>]</span>subsequently born into the same family they look for any kind of mark on the corresponding place on its body. If any such
be found they consider the child as a reincarnation of the deceased person. Still-born children, and those who die before
the Chathi or sixth-day ceremony of purification, are not taken to the burial-ground, but their bodies are placed in an earthen
pot and interred below the doorway or in the courtyard of the house. In such cases no funeral feast is demanded from the family,
and some people believe that the custom tends in favour of the mother bearing another child; others say, however, that its
object is to prevent the <i>tonhi</i> or witch from getting hold of the body of the child and rousing its spirit to life to do her bidding as Matia Deo.<a id="d0e10738src" href="#d0e10738" class="noteref">17</a> In Seoni a curious rule obtains to the effect that the bodies of those who eat carrion or the flesh of animals dying a natural
death should be cremated. In the northern Districts a bier painted white is used for a man and a red one for a woman.

<div class="div2" id="d0e10743">
<h3>8. Childbirth.</h3>
<p>Among the better-class Cham&#257;rs it is customary to place a newborn child in a winnowing-fan on a bed of rice. The nurse receives
the rice and she also goes round to the houses of the headman of the village and the relatives of the family and makes a mark
with cowdung on their doors as an announcement of the birth, for which she receives a small present. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh a woman
is given nothing to eat or drink on the day that a child is born and for two days afterwards. On the fourth day she receives
a liquid decoction of ginger, the roots of the <i>orai</i> or <i>khaskhas</i> grass, areca-nut, coriander and turmeric and other hot substances, and in some places a cake of linseed or sesamum. She sometimes
goes on drinking this mixture for as long as a month, and usually receives solid food for the first time on the sixth day
after the birth, when she bathes and her impurity is removed. The child is not permitted to suckle its mother until the third
day after it is born, but before this it receives a small quantity of a mixture made by boiling the urine of a calf with some
medicinal root. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh it is a common practice to brand a child on the stomach on the name-day or sixth day after
its birth; twenty or more small burns may be made with the point of a <i>hansia</i> or sickle on the <a id="d0e10757"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10757">414</a>]</span>stomach, and it is supposed that this operation will prevent it from catching cold. Another preventive for convulsions and
diseases of the lungs is the rubbing of the limbs and body with castor-oil; the nurse wets her hands with the oil and then
warms them before a fire and rubs the child. It is also held in the smoke of burning <i>ajw&#257;in</i> plants (<i>Carum copticum</i>). Infants are named on the Chathi or sixth day, or sometimes on the twelfth day after birth. The child&#8217;s head is shaved,
and the hair, known as Jh&#257;lar, thrown away, the mother and child are washed and the males of the family are shaved. The mother
is given her first regular meal of grain and pulse cooked with pumpkins. A pregnant woman who is afraid that her child will
die will sometimes sell it to a neighbour before its birth for five or six cowries.<a id="d0e10765src" href="#d0e10765" class="noteref">18</a> The baby will then be named Pachkouri or Chhekouri, and it is thought that the gods, who are jealous of the lives of children,
will overlook one whose name shows it to be valueless. Children are often nicknamed after some peculiarity as K&#257;nwa (one-eyed),
Behra (deaf), Konda (dumb), Khurwa (lame), K&#257;ri (black), Bh&#363;ri (fair). It does not follow that a child called Konda is actually
dumb, but it may simply have been late in learning to speak. Parents are jealous of exposing their children to the gaze of
strangers and especially of a crowd, in which there will almost certainly be some malignant person to cast the evil eye upon
them. Young children are therefore not infrequently secluded in the house and deprived of light and air to an extent which
is highly injurious to them.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10768">
<h3>9. Religion.</h3>
<p>The caste worship the ordinary Hindu and village deities of the localities in which they reside, and observe the principal
festivals. In Saugor the Cham&#257;rs have a family god, known as Marri, who is represented by a lump of clay kept in the cooking-room
of the house. He is supposed to represent the ancestors of the family. The Seoni Cham&#257;rs especially worship the castor-oil
plant. Generally the caste revere the <i>r&#257;mpi</i> or skinning-knife with offerings of flour-cakes and cocoanuts on festival days. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh more than half the Cham&#257;rs
belong to the reformed Satn&#257;mi sect, by which the worship of images is at least nominally abolished. This <a id="d0e10776"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10776">415</a>]</span>is separately treated. Mr. Gordon states<a id="d0e10778src" href="#d0e10778" class="noteref">19</a> that it is impossible to form a clear conception of the beliefs of the village Cham&#257;rs as to the hereafter: &#8220;That they have
the idea of hell as a place of punishment may be gathered from the belief that if salt is spilt the one who does this will
in Pat&#257;l&#8212;or the infernal region&#8212;have to gather up each grain of salt with his eyelids. Salt is for this reason handed round
with great care, and it is considered unlucky to receive it in the palm of the hand; it is therefore invariably taken in a
cloth or in a vessel. There is a belief that the spirit of the deceased hovers round familiar scenes and places, and on this
account, whenever it is possible, it is customary to destroy or desert the house in which any one has died. If a house is
deserted the custom is to sweep and plaster the place, and then, after lighting a lamp, to leave it in the house and withdraw
altogether. After the spirit of the dead has wandered around restlessly for a certain time it is said that it will again become
incarnate and take the form of man or of one of the lower animals.&#8221;

<div class="div2" id="d0e10783">
<h3>10. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The curing and tanning of hides is the primary occupation of the Cham&#257;r, but in 1911 only 80,000 persons, or about a seventh
of the actual workers of the caste, were engaged in it, and by Satn&#257;mis the trade has been entirely eschewed. The majority
of the Chhatt&#299;sgarhi Cham&#257;rs are cultivators with tenant right, and a number of them have obtained villages. In the northern
Districts, however, the caste are as a rule miserably poor, and none of them own villages. A very few are tenants, and the
vast majority despised and bullied helots. The condition of the leather-working Cham&#257;rs is described by Mr. Trench as lamentable.<a id="d0e10788src" href="#d0e10788" class="noteref">20</a> Chief among the causes of their ruin has been the recently established trade in raw hides. Formerly the bodies of all cattle
dying within the precincts of the village necessarily became the property of the Cham&#257;rs, as the Hindu owners could not touch
them without loss of caste. But since the rise of the cattle-slaughtering industry the cultivator has put his religious scruples
in his pocket, and sells his old and worn-out animals to the butchers for a respectable sum. &#8220;For a mere walking skeleton
of a cow or bullock from <a id="d0e10793"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10793">416</a>]</span>two to four rupees may be had for the asking, and so long as he does not actually see or stipulate for the slaughter of the
sacred animal, the cultivator&#8217;s scruples remain dormant. No one laments this lapse from orthodoxy more sincerely than the
outcaste Cham&#257;r. His situation may be compared with that of the Cornish pilchard-fishers, for whom the growing laxity on the
part of continental Roman Catholic countries in the observance of Lent is already more than an omen of coming disaster.&#8221;<a id="d0e10795src" href="#d0e10795" class="noteref">21</a>

<h3>11. The tanning process.</h3>
<p>When a hide is to be cured the inside is first cleaned with the <i>r&#257;mpi</i>, a chisel-like implement with a short blade four inches broad and a thick short handle. It is then soaked in a mixture of
water and lime for ten or twelve days, and at intervals scraped clean of flesh and hair with the <i>r&#257;mpi</i>. &#8220;The skill of a good tanner appears in the absence of superfluous inner skin, fat or flesh, remaining to be removed after
the hide is finally taken out of the lime-pit. Next the hard berries of the <i>ghont</i><a id="d0e10817src" href="#d0e10817" class="noteref">22</a> tree are poured into a large earthen vessel sunk in the ground, and water added till the mixture is so thick as to become
barely liquid. In this the folded hide is dipped three or four times a day, undergoing meanwhile a vigorous rubbing and kneading.
The average duration of this process is eight days, and it is followed by what is according to European ideas the real tanning.
Using as thread the roots of the ubiquitous <i>pal&#257;s</i><a id="d0e10823src" href="#d0e10823" class="noteref">23</a> tree, the Cham&#257;r sews the hide up into a mussack-shaped bag open at the neck. The sewing is admirably executed, and when
drawn tight the seams are nearly, but purposely not quite, water-tight. The hide is then hung on low stout scaffolding over
a pit and filled with a decoction of the dried and semi-powdered leaves of the <i>dhaura</i><a id="d0e10829src" href="#d0e10829" class="noteref">24</a> tree mixed with water. As the decoction trickles slowly through the seams below, more is poured on from above, and from time
to time the position of the hide is reversed in such a way that the tanning permeates each part in turn. Sometimes only one
reversal of the hide takes place half-way through the process, which occupies as a rule some <a id="d0e10833"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10833">417</a>]</span>eight days. But energetic Cham&#257;rs continually turn and refill the skin until satisfied that it is thoroughly saturated with
the tanning. After a washing in clean water the hide is now considered to be tanned.&#8221;<a id="d0e10835src" href="#d0e10835" class="noteref">25</a>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10841">
<h3>12. Shoes.</h3>
<p>In return for receiving the hides of the village cattle the Cham&#257;r had to supply the village proprietor and his family with
a pair of shoes each free of payment once a year, and sometimes also the village accountant and watchman; but the cultivators
had usually to pay for them, though nowadays they also often insist on shoes in exchange for their hides. Shoes are usually
worn in the wheat and cotton growing areas, but are less common in the rice country, where they would continually stick in
the mud of the fields. The Saugor or Bundelkhandi shoe is a striking specimen of footgear. The sole is formed of as many as
three layers of stout hide, and may be nearly an inch thick. The uppers in a typical shoe are of black soft leather, inlaid
with a simple pattern in silver thread. These are covered by flaps of stamped yellow goat-skin cut in triangular and half-moon
patterns, the interstices between the flaps being filled with red cloth. The heel-piece is continued more than half-way up
the calf behind. The toe is pointed, curled tightly over backwards and surmounted by a brass knob. The high frontal shield
protects the instep from mud and spear-grass, and the heel-piece ensures the retention of the shoe in the deepest quagmire.
Such shoes cost one or two rupees a pair.<a id="d0e10846src" href="#d0e10846" class="noteref">26</a> In the rice Districts sandals are often worn on the road, and laid aside when the cultivator enters his fields. Women go
bare-footed as a rule, but sometimes have sandals. Up till recently only prostitutes wore shoes in public, and no respectable
woman would dare to do so. In towns boots and shoes made in the English fashion at Cawnpore and other centres have now been
generally adopted, and with these socks are worn. The Mochis and J&#299;ngars, who are offshoots from the Cham&#257;r caste, have adopted
the distinctive occupations of making shoes and horse furniture with prepared leather, and no longer cure hides. They have
<a id="d0e10851"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10851">418</a>]</span>thus developed into a separate caste, and consider themselves greatly superior to the Cham&#257;rs.

<h3>13. Other articles made of leather.</h3>
<p>Other articles made of leather are the thongs and nose-strings for bullocks, the buckets for irrigation wells, rude country
saddlery, and <i>mussacks</i> and <i>pakh&#257;ls</i> for carrying water. These last are simply hides sewn into a bag and provided with an orifice. To make a pair of bellows a
goat-skin is taken with all four legs attached, and wetted and filled with sand. It is then dried in the sun, the sand shaken
out, the sticks fitted at the hind-quarters for blowing, and the pair of bellows is complete.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10868">
<h3>14. Customs connected with shoes.</h3>
<p>The shoe, as everybody in India knows, is a symbol of the greatest degradation and impurity. This is partly on account of
its manufacture from the impure leather or hide, and also perhaps because it is worn and trodden under foot. All the hides
of tame animals are polluted and impure, but those of certain wild animals, such as the deer and tiger, are not so, being
on the contrary to some extent sacred. This last feeling may be due to the fact that the old anchorites of the forests were
accustomed to cover themselves with the skins of wild animals, and to use them for sitting and kneeling to pray. A Bair&#257;gi
or Vaishnava religious mendicant much likes to carry a tiger-skin on his body if he can afford one; and a Br&#257;hman will have
the skin of a black-buck spread in the room where he performs his devotions. Possibly the sin involved in killing tame animals
has been partly responsible for the impurity attaching to their hides, to the obtaining of which the death of the animal must
be a preliminary. Every Hindu removes his shoes before entering a house, though with the adoption of English boots a breach
is being made in this custom. So far as the houses of Europeans are concerned, the retention of shoes is not, as might be
imagined, of recent origin, but was noticed by Buchanan a hundred years ago: &#8220;Men of rank and their attendants continue to
wear their shoes loose for the purpose of throwing them off whenever they enter a room, which they still continue to do everywhere
except in the houses of Europeans, in which all natives of rank now imitate our example.&#8221; In this connection it must be remembered
that a Hindu house is always sacred as the shrine of the <a id="d0e10873"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10873">419</a>]</span>household god, and shoes are removed before stepping across the threshold on to the hallowed ground. This consideration does
not apply to European houses, and affords ground for dispensing with the removal of laced shoes and boots.

</p>
<p>To be beaten or sometimes even touched with a shoe by a man of low caste entails temporary social excommunication to most
Hindus, and must be expiated by a formal purification and caste feast. The outcaste Mah&#257;rs punish a member of their community
in the same manner even if somebody should throw a shoe on to the roof of his house, and the Pharasaical absurdities of the
caste system surely find their culminating point in this rule. Similarly if a man touches his shoe with his hand and says
&#8216;I have beaten you,&#8217; to a member of any of the lower castes in Seoni, the person so addressed is considered as temporarily
out of caste. If he then immediately goes and informs his caste-fellows he is reinstated with a nominal fine of grain worth
one or two pice. But if he goes back to his house and takes food, and the incident is subsequently discovered, a penalty of
a goat is levied. A curious exception recognised is that of the <i>Sirk&#257;ri j&#363;ta</i>, or shoe belonging to a Government servant, and to be beaten with this shoe does not entail social punishment.

<h3>15. The Cham&#257;r as general village drudge.</h3>
<p>In return for his perquisite of the hides of cattle the Cham&#257;r has to act as the general village drudge in the northern Districts
and is always selected for the performance of <i>big&#257;r</i> or forced labour. When a Government officer visits the village the Cham&#257;r must look after him, fetch what grass or fuel he
requires, and accompany him as far as the next village to point out the road. He is also the bearer of official letters and
messages sent to the village. The special Cham&#257;r on whom these duties are imposed usually receives a plot of land rent-free
from the village proprietor. Another of the functions of the Cham&#257;r is the castration of the young bullocks, which task the
cultivators will not do for themselves. His method is most primitive, the scrotum being held in a cleft bamboo or a pair of
iron pincers, while the testicles are bruised and rubbed to pulp with a stone. The animal remains ill for a week or a fortnight
and is not <a id="d0e10888"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10888">420</a>]</span>worked for two months, but the operation is rarely or never fatal. In the northern Districts the Cham&#257;rs are said to be very
strong and to make the best farmservants and coolies for earthwork. It is a proverb that &#8216;The Cham&#257;r has half a rib more than
other men.&#8217; Notwithstanding his strength, however, he is a great coward, this characteristic having probably been acquired
through centuries of oppression. Many Cham&#257;r women act as midwives. In Raipur the cultivators give her five annas at the birth
of a boy and four annas for a girl, while well-to-do people pay a rupee. When the first child of a rich man is born, the midwife,
barber and washerman go round to all his friends and relations to announce the event and obtain presents. It is a regular
function of the Cham&#257;rs to remove the carcases of dead cattle, which they eat without regard to the disease from which the
animal may have died. But a Cham&#257;r will not touch the corpse of a pony, camel, cat, dog, squirrel or monkey, and to remove
the bodies of such animals a Mehtar (sweeper) or a Gond must be requisitioned. In Raipur it is said that the Cham&#257;rs will
eat only the flesh of four-legged animals, avoiding presumably birds and fish. When acting as a porter the Cham&#257;r usually
carries a load on his head, whereas the Kah&#257;r bears it on his shoulders, and this distinction is proverbial. In Raipur the
Cham&#257;rs have become retail cattle-dealers and are known as Kochias. They purchase cattle at the large central markets of Baloda
and Bamnidih and retail them at the small village baz&#257;rs. It is said that this trade could only flourish in Chhatt&#299;sgarh,
where the cultivators are too lazy to go and buy their cattle for themselves. Many Cham&#257;rs have emigrated from Chhatt&#299;sgarh
to the Assam tea-gardens, and others have gone to Calcutta and to the railway workshops at Kharagpur and Chakardharpur. Many
of them work as porters on the railway. It is probable that their taste for emigration is due to the resentment felt at their
despised position in Chhatt&#299;sgarh.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10890">
<h3>16. Social status.</h3>
<p>The Cham&#257;r ranks at the very bottom of the social scale, and contact with his person is considered to be a defilement to high-caste
Hindus. He cannot draw water from the common well and usually lives in a hamlet somewhat removed <a id="d0e10895"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10895">421</a>]</span>from the main village. But in several localities the rule is not so strict, and in Saugor a Cham&#257;r may go into all parts of
the house except the cooking and eating rooms. This is almost necessary when he is so commonly employed as a farmservant.
Here the village barber will shave Cham&#257;rs and the washerman will wash their clothes. And the Cham&#257;r himself will not touch
the corpse of a horse, a dog or any animal whose feet are uncloven; and he will not kill a cow though he eats its flesh. It
is stated indeed that a Cham&#257;r who once killed a calf accidentally had to go to the Ganges to purify himself. The crime of
cattle-poisoning is thus rare in Saugor and the other northern Districts, but in the east of the Provinces it is a common
practice of the Cham&#257;rs. As is usual with the low castes, many Cham&#257;rs are in some repute as Gunias or sorcerers, and in this
capacity they are frequently invited to enter the houses of Hindus to heal persons possessed of evil spirits. When children
fall ill one of them is called in and he waves a branch of the <i>nim</i><a id="d0e10899src" href="#d0e10899" class="noteref">27</a> tree over the child and taking ashes in his hand blows them at it; he is also consulted for hysterical women. When a Cham&#257;r
has had something stolen and wishes to detect the thief, he takes the wooden-handled needle used for stitching leather and
sticks the spike into the sole of a shoe. Then two persons standing in the relation of maternal uncle and nephew hold the
needle and shoe up by placing their forefingers under the wooden handle. The names of all suspected persons are pronounced,
and he at whose name the shoe turns on the needle is taken to be the thief.

</p>
<p>The caste do not employ Br&#257;hmans for their ceremonies, but consult them for the selection of auspicious days, as this business
can be performed by the Br&#257;hman at home and he need not enter the Cham&#257;r&#8217;s house. But poor and despised as the Cham&#257;rs are
they have a pride of their own. When the Dohar and Mar&#257;tha Cham&#257;rs sell shoes to a Mah&#257;r they will only allow him to try on
one of them and not both, and this, too, he must do in a sitting posture, as an indication of humility. The Harale or Mar&#257;tha
Cham&#257;rs of Ber&#257;r<a id="d0e10905src" href="#d0e10905" class="noteref">28</a> do not eat beef nor work with untanned leather, and they will not work for the lowest castes, as Mah&#257;rs, M&#257;ngs, Basors and
<a id="d0e10910"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10910">422</a>]</span>Kolis. If one of these buys a pair of shoes from the Cham&#257;r the seller asks no indiscreet questions; but he will not mend
the pair as he would for a man of higher caste. The Satn&#257;mis of Chhatt&#299;sgarh have openly revolted against the degraded position
to which they are relegated by Hinduism and are at permanent feud with the Hindus; some of them have even adopted the sacred
thread. But this interesting movement is separately discussed in the article on Satn&#257;mi.

<div class="div2" id="d0e10912">
<h3>17. Character.</h3>
<p>In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the Cham&#257;rs are the most criminal class of the population, and have made a regular practice of poisoning cattle
with arsenic in order to obtain the hides and flesh. They either mix the poison with mahua flowers strewn on the grazing-ground,
or make it into a ball with butter and insert it into the anus of the animal when the herdsman is absent. They also commit
cattle-theft and frequently appear at the whipping-post before the court-house. The estimation in which they are held by their
neighbours is reflected in the proverb, &#8216;Hemp, rice and a Cham&#257;r; the more they are pounded the better they are.&#8217; &#8220;The caste,&#8221;
Mr. Trench writes, &#8220;are illiterate to a man, and their intellectual development is reflected in their style of living. A visit
to a hamlet of tanning Cham&#257;rs induces doubt as to whence the appalling smells of the place proceed&#8212;from the hides or from
the tanners. Were this squalor invariably, as it is occasionally, accompanied by a sufficiency of the necessaries of life,
victuals and clothing, the Cham&#257;r would not be badly off, but the truth is that in the northern Districts at all events the
Cham&#257;r, except in years of good harvest, does not get enough to eat. This fact is sufficiently indicated by a glance at the
perquisites of the village Cham&#257;r, who is almost invariably the shoemaker and leather-worker for his little community. In
one District the undigested grain left by the gorged bullocks on the threshing-floor is his portion, and a portion for which
he will sometimes fight. Everywhere he is a carrion-eater, paying little or no regard to the disease from which the animal
may have died.&#8221; The custom above mentioned of washing grain from the dung of cattle is not so repugnant to the Hindus, owing
to the sacred character of the cow, as it is to us. It is even sometimes <a id="d0e10917"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10917">423</a>]</span>considered holy food:&#8212;&#8220;The zam&#299;nd&#257;r of Idar, who is named Naron D&#257;s, lives with such austerity that his only food is grain
which has passed through oxen and has been separated from their dung; and this kind of aliment the Br&#257;hmans consider pure
in the highest degree.&#8221;<a id="d0e10919src" href="#d0e10919" class="noteref">29</a> Old-fashioned cultivators do not muzzle the bullocks treading out the corn, and the animals eat it the whole time, so that
much passes through their bodies undigested. The Cham&#257;r will make several maunds (80 lbs.) of grain in this way, and to a
cultivator who does not muzzle his bullocks he will give a pair of shoes and a plough-rein and yoke-string. Another duty of
the Cham&#257;r is to look after the <i>banda</i> or large underground masonry chamber in which grain is kept. After the grain has been stored, a conical roof is built and
plastered over with mud to keep out water. The Cham&#257;r looks after the repairs of the mud plaster and in return receives a
small quantity of grain, which usually goes bad on the floor of the store-chamber. They prepare the threshing-floors for the
cultivators, making the surface of the soil level and beating it down to a smooth and hard surface. In return for this they
receive the grain mixed with earth which remains on the threshing-floor after the crop is removed.

</p>
<p>Like all other village artisans the Cham&#257;r is considered by the cultivators to be faithless and dilatory in his dealings with
them; and they vent their spleen in sayings such as the following:&#8212;&#8220;The Kori, the Cham&#257;r and the Ah&#299;r, these are the three
biggest liars that ever were known. For if you ask the Cham&#257;r whether he has mended your shoes he says, &#8216;I am at the last
stitch,&#8217; when he has not begun them; if you ask the Ah&#299;r whether he has brought back your cow from the jungle he says, &#8216;It
has come, it has come,&#8217; without knowing or caring whether it has come or not; and if you ask the Kori whether he has made
your cloth he says, &#8216;It is on the loom,&#8217; when he has not so much as bought the thread.&#8221; Another proverb conveying the same
sense is, &#8216;The Mochi&#8217;s to-morrow never comes.&#8217; But no doubt the uncertainty and delay in payment account for much of this
conduct.

</span><h2>Chasa</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10936">
<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Chasa</b>,<a id="d0e10943src" href="#d0e10943" class="noteref">1</a> <b>Tasa</b> (also called Alia in the Sonpur and Patna States).&#8212;The chief cultivating caste of Orissa. In 1901 more than 21,000 Chasas
were enumerated in Sambalpur and the adjoining Feudatory States, but nearly all these passed in 1905 to Bengal. The Chasas
are said<a id="d0e10949src" href="#d0e10949" class="noteref">2</a> by Sir H. Risley to be for the most part of non-Aryan descent, the loose organisation of the caste system among the Uriyas
making it possible on the one hand for outsiders to be admitted into the caste, and on the other for wealthy Chasas who gave
up ploughing with their own hands and assumed the respectable title of Mahanti to raise themselves to membership among the
lower classes of K&#257;yasths. This passage indicates that the term Mahanti is or was a broader one than Karan or Uriya K&#257;yasth,
and was applied to educated persons of other castes who apparently aspired to admission among the Karans, in the same manner
as leading members of the warlike and landholding castes lay claim to rank as R&#257;jp&#363;ts. For this reason probably the Uriya
K&#257;yasths prefer the name of Karan to that of Mahanti, and the Uriya saying, &#8216;He who has no caste is called a Mahanti,&#8217; supports
this view. The word Chasa has the generic meaning of &#8216;a cultivator,&#8217; and the Chasas may in Sambalpur be merely an occupational
group recruited from other castes. This theory is supported by the names of their subdivisions, three of which, Kolta, Khandait
and Ud or Orh are the names of distinct castes, while the fourth, Benatia, is found as a subdivision of several other castes.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e10954">
<h3>2. Exogamous divisions.</h3>
<p>Each family has a <i>got</i> or sept and a <i>varga</i> or family name. The <i>vargas</i> are much more numerous than the <i>gots</i>, and marriages are arranged according to them, unions of members of the same <i>varga</i> only being forbidden. The sept names are totemistic and the family names territorial or titular. Among the former are <i>bachh&#257;s</i> (calf), <i>n&#257;gas</i> (cobra), <i>hasti</i> or <i>gaj</i> (elephant), <i>harin</i> (deer), <i>mahum&#257;chhi</i> (bee), <i>d&#299;pas</i> (lamp), and others; while instances of the <i>varga</i> names are Pitmundia, Hulbulsingia, Giringia and Dumania, <a id="d0e10998"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e10998">425</a>]</span>all names of villages in Angul State; and N&#257;yak (headman), Mahanti (writer), Dehri (worshipper), Behera (cook), Kandra (bamboo-worker),
and others. The different <i>gots</i> or septs revere their totems by drawing figures of them on their houses, and abstaining from injuring them in any way. If
they find the footprints of the animal which they worship, they bow to the marks and obliterate them with the hand, perhaps
with the view of affording protection to the totem animal from hunters or of preventing the marks from being trampled on by
others. They believe that if they injured the totem animal they would be attacked by leprosy and their line would die out.
Members of the <i>d&#299;pas</i> sept will not eat if a lamp is put out at night, and will not touch a lamp with unclean hands. Those of the <i>mahum&#257;chhi</i> or bee sept will not take honey from a comb or eat it. Those of the <i>gaj</i> sept will not join an elephant kheddah. Some of the septs have an Ishta Devata or tutelary Hindu deity to whom worship is
paid. Thus the elephant sept worship Ganesh, the elephant-headed god, and also do not kill rats because Ganesh rides on this
animal. Similarly the <i>harin</i> or deer sept have P&#257;wan, the god of the wind, as their Ishta Devata, because a deer is considered to be as swift as the wind.
It would appear then that the septs, each having its totem, were the original divisions for the restriction of marriage, but
as these increased in size they were felt to debar the union of persons who had no real relationship and hence the smaller
family groups were substituted for them; while in the case of the old septs, the substitution of the Hindu god representing
the animal worshipped by the sept for the animal itself as the object of veneration is an instance of the process of abandoning
totem or animal worship and conforming to Hinduism. In one or two cases the <i>vargas</i> themselves have been further subdivided for the purpose of marriage. Thus certain families of the Padh&#257;n (leader, chief)
<i>varga</i> were entrusted with the duty of readmitting persons temporarily put out of caste to social intercourse, for which they received
the remuneration of a rupee and a piece of cloth in each case. These families were called the Parichha or &#8216;Scrutinisers&#8217; and
have now become a separate <i>varga</i>, so that a Parichha Padh&#257;n may <a id="d0e11024"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11024">426</a>]</span>marry another Padh&#257;n. This is a further instance of the process of subdivision of exogamous groups which must take place as
the groups increase in size and numbers, and the original idea of the common ancestry of the group vanishes. Until finally
the primitive system of exogamy disappears and is replaced by the modern and convenient method of prohibition of marriage
within certain degrees of relationship.

<h3>3. Status and customs of the caste.</h3>
<p>The Chasas do not marry within the same <i>varga,</i> but a man may usually take a wife from his mother&#8217;s <i>varga</i>. A girl must always be wedded before arriving at adolescence, the penalty for breach of this rule being the driving out of
the girl to seclusion in the forest for a day and a half, and a feast to the caste-fellows. If no husband is available she
may be married to an arrow or a flower, or she goes through the form of marriage with any man in the caste, and when a suitable
partner is subsequently found, is united with him by the form of widow-marriage. Widows may marry again and divorce is also
allowed. The dead are usually buried if unmarried, and burnt when married. The Chasas worship the Hindu deities and also the
village god Gr&#257;msiri, who is represented by a stone outside the village. At festivals they offer animal sacrifices to their
agricultural implements, as hoes and hatchets. They employ Br&#257;hmans for religious ceremonies. They have an aversion to objects
of a black colour, and will not use black umbrellas or clothes woven with black thread. They do not usually wear shoes or
ride horses, even when they can afford these latter. Cultivation is the traditional occupation of the caste, and they are
tenants, farmservants and field-labourers. They take food from R&#257;jp&#363;ts and Br&#257;hmans, and sometimes from Koltas and Sudhs.
They eat flesh and fish, but abjure liquor, beef, pork and fowls. Their social position is a little below that of the good
agricultural castes, and they are considered somewhat stupid, as shown by the proverb:

</span><h2>Chauh&#257;n</h2>
<p><b>Chauh&#257;n.</b><a id="d0e11051src" href="#d0e11051" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A small caste of village watchmen and labourers in the Chhatt&#299;sgarh Division. They are also known as Chandel by outsiders.
In 1911 the Chauh&#257;ns numbered 7000 persons in the Raipur and Bil&#257;spur Districts, and the adjoining Feudatory States. The caste
claim themselves to be of R&#257;jp&#363;t origin, and say that their ancestors came from Mainpuri, which is the home of the Chauh&#257;n
clan of R&#257;jp&#363;ts. A few of their section names are taken from those of R&#257;jp&#363;t clans, but the majority are of a totemistic nature,
being called after animals and plants, as N&#257;g the cobra, Neora the mongoose, Kolhia the jackal, Kamal the lotus, Pat silk,
Ch&#257;nwar rice, Kh&#257;nda a sword, and so on. Members of each sept worship the object after which it is named at the time of marriage,
and if the tree or animal itself is not readily available, they make a representation of it in flour and pay their respects
to that. Thus members of the Bedna or sugarcane sept make a stick of flour and worship it. They will not kill or eat their
sept totem, but in some cases, as in that of the Ch&#257;nwar or rice sept, this rule is impossible of observance, so the members
of this sept content themselves with abstaining from a single variety of rice, the kind called N&#257;gkesar. Families who belong
to septs named after heroic ancestors make an image in flour of the ancestral saint or hero and worship it. The caste employ
Br&#257;hmans for their marriage and other ceremonies, and will not take food from any caste except Br&#257;hmans and their Bair&#257;gi
<i>gurus</i> or spiritual preceptors. But their social position is very low, as none except the most debased castes will take food or
water from their hands, and their hereditary calling of village watchman would not be practised by any respectable caste.
By outsiders they are considered little, if at all, superior to the Pankas and G&#257;ndas, and the most probable theory of their
origin is that they are the descendants of irregular alliances between immigrant R&#257;jp&#363;t adventurers and the women of the country.
Their social customs resemble those of other low castes in Chhatt&#299;sgarh. Before the bridegroom starts for a wedding, they
have a peculiar ceremony known as Naodori. Seven small earthen cups full of water are placed on the boy&#8217;s head, and <a id="d0e11057"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11057">428</a>]</span>then poured over him in succession. A piece of new cloth is laid on his head, and afterwards placed seven times in contact
with the earth. During this ritual the boy keeps his eyes shut, and it is believed that if he should open them before its
completion, his children would be born blind. When the bride leaves her father&#8217;s house she and all her relatives mourn and
weep noisily, and the bride continues doing so until she is well over a mile from her own village. Similarly on the first
three or four visits which she pays to her parents after her wedding, she begins crying loudly a mile away from their house,
and continues until she reaches it. It is the etiquette also that women should cry whenever they meet relatives from a distance.
In such cases when two women see each other they cry together, each placing her head on the other&#8217;s shoulder and her hands
at her sides. While they cry they change the position of their heads two or three times, and each addresses the other according
to their relationship, as mother, sister, and so on. Or if any member of the family has recently died, they call upon him
or her, exclaiming &#8216;O my mother! O my sister! O my father! Why did not I, unfortunate one, die instead of thee?&#8217; A woman when
weeping with a man holds to his sides and rests her head against his breast. The man exclaims at intervals, &#8216;Stop crying,
do not cry.&#8217; When two women are weeping together it is a point of etiquette that the elder should stop first and then beg
her companion to do so, but if it is doubtful which is the elder, they sometimes go on crying for an hour at a time, exciting
the younger spectators to mirth, until at length some elder steps forward and tells one of them to stop. The Chauhans permit
the remarriage of widows, and a woman is bound by no restrictions as to her choice of a second husband.

</p>
<p>The goddess D&#363;rga or Devi is chiefly revered by the caste, who observe fasts in her honour in the months of Kunw&#257;r (September)
and Chait (March). When they make a <i>badna</i> or vow, they usually offer goats to the goddess, and sow the <i>Jawaras</i> or Gardens of Adonis in her name, but except on such occasions they present less costly articles, as cocoanuts, betel-leaves,
areca-nuts and flowers. On the Dasahra festival they worship the <i>l&#257;thi</i> or stick which is the <a id="d0e11070"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11070">429</a>]</span>badge of office of the village watchman. They were formerly addicted to petty theft, and it is said that they worshipped the
<i>khunta</i> or pointed rod for digging through the wall of a house. The caste usually burn the dead, but children whose ears or noses
have not been pierced are buried. Children who die before they have begun to eat grain are not mourned at all, while for older
children the period of mourning is three to seven days, and for adults ten days. On the tenth day they clean their houses,
shave themselves and offer balls of rice to the dead under the direction of a Br&#257;hman, to whom they present eating and drinking
vessels, clothes, shoes and cattle with the belief that the articles will thus become available for the use of the dead man
in the other world. The Chauh&#257;ns will not eat fowls, pork or beef, and in some places they abstain from drinking liquor.

</span><h2>Chh&#299;pa</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11078">
<h3>1. Constitution of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Chh&#299;pa, Rang&#257;ri, Bhaosar, Nir&#257;li, N&#299;lgar.</b>&#8212;The Hindu caste of cotton printers and dyers. They are commonly known as Chh&#299;pa in the northern Districts and Rang&#257;ri or
Bhaosar in the Maratha country. The Chh&#299;pas and Rang&#257;ris together number about 23,000 persons. In the south of the Central
Provinces and Ber&#257;r cotton is a staple crop, and the cotton-weaving industry is much stronger than in the north, and as a
necessary consequence the dyers also would be more numerous. Though the Chh&#299;pas and Rang&#257;ris do not intermarry or dine together,
no essential distinction exists between them. They are both of functional origin, pursue exactly the same occupation, and
relate the same story about themselves, and no good reason therefore exists for considering them as separate castes. N&#299;lgar
or Nir&#257;li is a purely occupational term applied to Chh&#299;pas or Rang&#257;ris who work in indigo (<i>n&#299;l</i>); while Bhaosar is another name for the Rang&#257;ris in the northern Districts.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11088">
<h3>2. Its origin and position.</h3>
<p>The Rang&#257;ris say that when Parasur&#257;ma, the Br&#257;hman, was slaying the Kshatriyas, two brothers of the warrior caste took refuge
in a temple of Devi. One of them, called Bhaosar, threw himself upon the image, while the other hid behind it. The goddess
saved them both and told them to adopt the vocation of dyers. The Rang&#257;ris are descended <a id="d0e11093"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11093">430</a>]</span>from the brother who was called Bhaosar and the Chh&#299;pas from the other brother, because he hid behind the image (<i>chhipna</i>, to hide). The word is really derived from <i>chh&#257;pna</i>, to print, because the Chh&#299;pas print coloured patterns on cotton cloths with wooden stamps. Rang&#257;ri comes from the common
word <i>rang</i> or colour. The Chh&#299;pas have a slightly different version of the same story, according to which the goddess gave one brother
a needle and a piece of thread, and the other some red betel-leaf which she spat at him out of her mouth; and told one to
follow the vocation of a tailor, and the other that of a dyer. Hence the first was called Chh&#299;pi or Shimpi and the second
Chh&#299;pa. This story indicates a connection between the dyeing and tailoring castes in the Mar&#257;tha Districts, which no doubt
exists, as one subcaste of the Rang&#257;ris is named after N&#257;mdeo, the patron saint of the Shimpis or tailors. Both the dyeing
and tailoring industries are probably of considerably later origin than that of cotton-weaving, and both are urban rather
than village industries. And this consideration perhaps accounts for the fact that the Chh&#299;pas and Rang&#257;ris rank higher than
most of the weaving castes, and no stigma or impurity attaches to them.

</div><p>



</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11108">
<h3>3. Caste subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The caste have a number of subdivisions, such as the Malaiyas or immigrants from M&#257;lwa, the Gujr&#257;ti who come from Gujar&#257;t,
the Golias or those who dye cloth with <i>goli ka rang</i>, the fugitive aniline dyes, the N&#257;mdeos who belong to the sect founded by the Darzi or tailor of that name, and the Khatris,
these last being members of the Khatri caste who have adopted the profession.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11116">
<h3>4. Marriage and other customs.</h3>
<p>Marriage is forbidden between persons so closely connected as to have a common ancestor in the third generation. In Bhand&#257;ra
it is obligatory on all members of the caste, who know the bride or bridegroom, to ask him or her to dine. The marriage rite
is that prevalent among the Hindust&#257;ni castes, of walking round the sacred post. Divorce and the marriage of widows are permitted.
In Narsinghpur, when a bachelor marries a widow, he first goes through a mock ceremony by walking seven times round an earthen
vessel filled with cakes; this rite being known as Langra Biy&#257;h or the lame marriage. The caste burn their dead, placing the
head to the north. On the day of Dasahra the <a id="d0e11121"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11121">431</a>]</span>Chh&#299;pas worship their wooden stamps, first washing them and then making an offering to them of a cocoanut, flowers and an
image consisting of a bottle-gourd standing on four sticks, which is considered to represent a goat. The Chh&#299;pas rank with
the lower artisan castes, from whose hands Br&#257;hmans will not take water. Nevertheless some of them wear the sacred thread
and place sect-marks on their foreheads.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11123">
<h3>5. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The bulk of the Chh&#299;pas dye cloths in red, blue or black, with ornamental patterns picked out on them in black and white.
Formerly their principal agent was the <i>al</i> or Indian mulberry (<i>Morinda citrifolia</i>), from which a rich red dye is obtained. But this indigenous product has been ousted by alizarin, a colouring agent made
from coal-tar, which is imported from Germany, and is about thirty per cent cheaper than the native dye. Chh&#299;pas prepare <i>sar&#299;s</i> or women&#8217;s wearing-cloths, and floor and bed cloths. The dye stamps are made of teakwood by an ordinary carpenter, the flat
surface of the wood being hollowed out so as to leave ridges which form either a design in curved lines or the outlines of
the figures of men, elephants and tigers. There is a great variety of patterns, as many as three hundred stamps having been
found in one Chh&#299;pa&#8217;s shop. The stamps are usually covered with a black ink made of sulphate of iron, and this is fixed by
myrobalans; the N&#299;lgars usually dye a plain blue with indigotin. No great variety or brilliancy of colours is obtained by
the Hindu dyers, who are much excelled in this branch of the art by the Muhammadan Rangrez. In Gujar&#257;t dyeing is strictly
forbidden by the caste rules of the Chh&#299;pas or Bhaosars during the four rainy months, because the slaughter of insects in
the dyeing vat adds to the evil and ill-luck of that sunless time.<a id="d0e11137src" href="#d0e11137" class="noteref">1</a>

<div class="div2" id="d0e11182">
<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Chit&#257;ri, Chiter, Chitrak&#257;r, Mah&#257;rana.</b>&#8212;A caste of painters on wood and plaster. Chiter is the Hindust&#257;ni, and Chit&#257;ri the Mar&#257;thi name, both being corruptions of
the Sanskrit Chitrak&#257;r. Mah&#257;rana is the term used in the Uriya country, where the caste are also known as Ph&#257;l-Barhai, or
a carpenter who only works on one side of the wood. Chit&#257;ri is further an occupational term applied to Mochis and J&#299;ngars,
or leather-workers, who have adopted the occupation of wall-painting, and there is no reason to doubt that the Chit&#257;ris were
originally derived from the Mochis, though they have now a somewhat higher position. In Mandla the Chitrak&#257;rs and J&#299;ngars
are separate castes, and do not eat or intermarry with one another. Neither branch will take water from the Mochis, who make
shoes, and some Chitrak&#257;rs even refuse to touch them. They say that the founder of their caste was Biskarma,<a id="d0e11189src" href="#d0e11189" class="noteref">1</a> the first painter, and that their ancestors were R&#257;jp&#363;ts, whose country was taken by Akbar. As they were without occupation
Akbar then assigned to them the business of making saddles and bridles for his cavalry and scabbards for their swords. It
is not unlikely that the J&#299;ngar caste did really originate or first become differentiated from the Mochis and Cham&#257;rs in R&#257;jput&#257;na
owing to the demand for such articles, and this would account for the Mochis and J&#299;ngars having adopted R&#257;jp&#363;t names for their
sections, and making a claim to R&#257;jp&#363;t <a id="d0e11192"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11192">433</a>]</span>descent. The Chitrak&#257;rs of Mandla say that their ancestors belonged to Garha, near Jubbulpore, where the tomb of a woman of
their family who became <i>sati</i> is still to be seen. Garha, which was once the seat of an important Gond dynasty with a garrison, would also naturally have
been a centre for their craft.

</p>
<p>Another legend traces their origin from Chitrarekha, a nymph who was skilled in painting and magic. She was the friend of
a princess Usha, whose father was king of Soh&#257;gpur in Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d. Usha fell in love with a beautiful young prince whom she
saw in a dream, and Chitrarekha drew the portraits of many gods and men for her, until finally Usha recognised the youth of
her dream in the portrait of Aniruddha, the grandson of Krishna. Chitrarekha then by her magic power brought Aniruddha to
Usha, but when her father found him in the palace he bound him and kept him in prison. On this Krishna appeared and rescued
his grandson, and taking Usha from her father married them to each other. The Chit&#257;ris say that as a reward to Chitrarekha,
Krishna promised her that her descendants should never be in want, and hence members of their caste do not lack for food even
in famine time.<a id="d0e11199src" href="#d0e11199" class="noteref">2</a> The Chit&#257;ris are declining in numbers, as their paintings are no longer in demand, the people preferring the cheap coloured
prints imported from Germany and England.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11202">
<h3>2. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The caste is a mixed occupational group, and those of Mar&#257;tha, Telugu and Hindust&#257;ni extraction marry among themselves. A
few wear the sacred thread, and abstain from eating flesh or drinking liquor, while the bulk of them do not observe these
restrictions.

</p>
<p>Among the J&#299;ngars women accompany the marriage procession, but not with the Chit&#257;ris.

</p>
<p>Widow-marriage is allowed, but among the Mah&#257;r&#257;nas a wife who has lived with her husband may not marry any one except his
younger brother, and if there are none she must remain a widow. In Mandla, if a widow marries her younger brother-in-law,
half her first husband&#8217;s property goes to him finally, and half to the first husband&#8217;s children. <a id="d0e11211"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11211">434</a>]</span>If she marries an outsider she takes her first husband&#8217;s property and children with her. Formerly if a wife misbehaved the
Chit&#257;ri sometimes sold her to the highest bidder, but this custom has fallen into abeyance, and now if a man divorces his
wife her father usually repays to him the expenses of his marriage. These he realises in turn from any man who takes his daughter.
A second wife worships the spirit of the dead first wife on the day of Akh&#257;tij, offering some food and a breast-cloth, so
that the spirit may not trouble her.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11213">
<h3>3. Birth and childhood.</h3>
<p>A pregnant woman must stay indoors during an eclipse; if she goes out and sees it they believe that her child will be born
deformed. They think that a woman in this condition must be given any food which she takes a fancy for, so far as may be practicable,
as to thwart her desires would affect the health of the child. Women in this condition sometimes have a craving for eating
earth; then they will eat either the scrapings or whitewash from the walls, or black clay soil, or the ashes of cowdung cakes
to the extent of a small handful a day. A woman&#8217;s first child should be born in her father-in-law&#8217;s or husband&#8217;s house if
possible, but at any rate not in her father&#8217;s house. And if she should be taken with the pangs of travail while on a visit
to her own family, they will send her to some other house for her child to be born. The ears of boys and the ears and nostrils
of girls are pierced, and until this is done they are not considered to be proper members of the caste and can take food from
any one&#8217;s hand. The Chit&#257;ris of Mandla permit a boy to do this until he is married. A child&#8217;s hair is not shaved when it is
born, but this should be done once before it is three years old, whether it be a boy or girl. After this the hair may be allowed
to grow, and shaved off or simply cut as they prefer. Except in the case of illness a girl&#8217;s hair is only shaved once, and
that of an adult woman is never cut, unless she becomes a widow and makes a pilgrimage to a sacred place, when it is shaved
off as an offering.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11218">
<h3>4. The evil eye.</h3>
<p>In order to avert the evil eye they hang round a child&#8217;s neck a nut called <i>bajar-battu</i>, the shell of which they say will crack and open if any one casts the evil eye on the child. If it is placed in milk the
two parts will come together again. <a id="d0e11226"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11226">435</a>]</span>They also think that the nut attracts the evil eye and absorbs its effect, and the child is therefore not injured. If they
think that some one has cast the evil eye on a child, they say a charm, &#8216;<i lang="und">Ishwar, Gauri, P&#257;rvati ke &#257;n nazar dur ho jao</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;Depart, Evil Eye, in the name of Mah&#257;deo and P&#257;rvati,&#8217; and as they say this they blow on the child three times; or
they take some salt, chillies and mustard in their hand and wave it round the child&#8217;s head and say, &#8216;<i lang="und">Telin k&#299; l&#257;gi ho, Tamolin k&#299; l&#257;gi ho, Mar&#257;rin k&#299; ho, Gorania (Gondin) k&#299; ho, oke, oke, parpar&#257;ke phut j&#257;we</i>,&#8217; &#8216;If it be a Telin, Tambolin, Mar&#257;rin or Gondin who has cast the evil eye, may her eyes crack and fall out.&#8217; And at the
same time they throw the mustard, chillies and salt on the fire so that the eyes of her who cast the evil eye may crack and
fall out as these things crackle in the fire.

</p>
<p>If tiger&#8217;s claws are used for an amulet, the points must be turned outwards. If any one intends to wish luck to a child, he
says, &#8216;<i lang="und">Tori balay&#257;n leun</i>,&#8217; and waves his hands round the child&#8217;s head several times to signify that he takes upon himself all the misfortunes which
are to happen to the child. Then he presses the knuckles of his hands against the sides of his own head till they crack, which
is a lucky omen, averting calamity. If the knuckles do not crack at the first attempt, it is repeated two or three times.
When a man sneezes he will say &#8216;Chatrapati,&#8217; which is considered to be a name of Devi, but is only used on this occasion.
But some say nothing. After yawning they snap their fingers, the object of which, they say, is to drive away sleep, as otherwise
the desire will become infectious and attack others present. But if a child yawns they sometimes hold one of their hands in
front of his mouth, and it is probable that the original meaning of the custom was to prevent evil spirits from entering through
the widely opened mouth, or the yawner&#8217;s own soul or spirit from escaping; and the habit of holding the hand before the mouth
from politeness when yawning inadvertently may be a reminiscence of this.

<div class="div2" id="d0e11239">
<h3>5. Cradle-songs.</h3>
<p>The following are some cradle-songs taken down from a Chitrak&#257;r, but probably used by most of the lower Hindu castes:

<p>This song commemorates a favourite incident in the life of Tulsi D&#257;s, the author of the R&#257;m&#257;yana, who when he was a little
boy was once sent by his <i>guru</i> to watch the crop. But after some time the <i>guru</i> came and found the field full of birds eating the corn and Tulsi D&#257;s watching them. When asked why he did not scare them
away, he said, &#8216;Are they not as much the creatures of R&#257;ma as I am? how should I deprive them of food?&#8217;

<h3>6. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The Chit&#257;ris pursue their old trade, principally in N&#257;gpur city, where the taste for wall-paintings still survives; and they
decorate the walls of houses with their crude red and blue colours. But they have now a number of other avocations. They paint
pictures on paper, making their colours from the tins of imported aniline dyeing-powders which are sold in the bazar; but
there is little demand for these. They make small pictures of the deities which the people hang on their walls for a day and
then throw away. They also paint the bodies of the men who pretend to be tigers at the Muharram festival, for which they charge
a rupee. They make the clay paper-covered masks of monkeys and demons worn by actors who play the R&#257;ml&#299;la or story of R&#257;ma
on the R&#257;mnaomi festival in Chait (March); they also make the <i>t&#257;zias</i> or representations of the tomb of Hussain and paper figures of human beings with small clay heads, which are carried in the
Muharram procession. They make marriage crowns; the frames of these are of conical shape with a half-moon at the top, made
from strips of bamboo; they are covered with red paper picked out with yellow and green and with tinfoil, and are ornamented
with borders of date-palm leaves. The crowns cost from four annas to a rupee each. They make the artificial flowers used at
weddings; these are stuck on a bamboo stick and at the arrival and departure of the bridegroom are scrambled for by the guests,
who take them home as keepsakes or give them to their children for playthings. The flowers copied are the lotus, rose and
chrysanthemum, and the imitations are quite good. Sometimes the bridegroom is <a id="d0e11329"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11329">438</a>]</span>surrounded by trays or boxes of flowers, carried in procession and arranged so as to look as if they were planted in beds.
Other articles made by the Chitrak&#257;r are paper fans, paper globes for hanging to the roofs of houses, Chinese lanterns made
either of paper or of mica covered with paper, and small caps of velvet embroidered with gold lace. At the Akti festival<a id="d0e11331src" href="#d0e11331" class="noteref">6</a> they make pairs of little clay dolls, dressing them as male and female, and sell them in red lacquered bamboo baskets, and
the girls take them to the jungle and pretend that they are married. Formerly the Chitrak&#257;rs made clay idols for temples,
but these have been supplanted by marble images imported from Jaipur. The J&#299;ngars make the cloth saddles on which natives
ride, and some of them bind books, the leather for which is made from goat-skin, and is not considered so impure as that made
from the hides of cattle. But one class of them, who are considered inferior, make leather harness from cow-hide and buffalo-hide.

</span><h2>Chitrakathi</h2>
<p><b>Chitrakathi, Hardas.</b><a id="d0e11340src" href="#d0e11340" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A small caste of religious mendicants and picture showmen in the Mar&#257;tha Districts. In 1901 they numbered 200 persons in
the Central Provinces and 1500 in Ber&#257;r, being principally found in the Amraoti District. The name, Mr. Enthoven writes,<a id="d0e11343src" href="#d0e11343" class="noteref">2</a> is derived from <i>chitra,</i> a picture, and <i>katha</i>, a story, and the professional occupation of the caste is to travel about exhibiting pictures of heroes and gods, and telling
stories about them. The community is probably of mixed functional origin, for in Bombay they have exogamous section-names
taken from those of the Mar&#257;thas, as J&#257;dhow, More, Pow&#257;r and so on, while in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r an entirely different
set is found. Here several sections appear to be named after certain offices held or functions performed by their members
at the caste feasts. Thus the Atak section are the caste headmen; the M&#257;nkari appear to be a sort of substitute for the Atak
or their grand viziers, the word <a id="d0e11354"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11354">439</a>]</span>M&#257;nkar being primarily a title applied to Mar&#257;tha noblemen, who held an official position at court; the Bhojni section serve
the food at marriage and other ceremonies; the K&#257;kra arrange for the lighting; the Koth&#257;rya are store-keepers; and the Ghoderao
(from <i>ghoda</i>, a horse) have the duty of looking after the horses and bullock-carts of the castemen who assemble. The Chitrakathis are
really no doubt the same caste as the Chit&#257;ris or Chitrak&#257;rs (painters) of the Central Provinces, and, like them, a branch
of the Mochis (tanners), and originally derived from the Cham&#257;rs. But as the Ber&#257;r Chitrakathis are migratory instead of settled,
and in other respects differ from the Chit&#257;ris, they are treated in a separate article. Marriage within the section is forbidden,
and, besides this, members of the Atak and M&#257;nkari sections cannot intermarry as they are considered to be related, being
divisions of one original section. The social customs of the caste resemble those of the Kunbis, but they bury their dead
in a sitting posture, with the face to the east, and on the eighth day erect a platform over the grave. At the festival of
Akhat&#299;j (3rd of light Bais&#257;kh)<a id="d0e11359src" href="#d0e11359" class="noteref">3</a> they worship a vessel of water in honour of their dead ancestors, and in Kunw&#257;r (September) they offer oblations to them.
Though not impure, the caste occupy a low social position, and are said to prostitute their married women and tolerate sexual
licence on the part of unmarried girls. Mr. Kitts<a id="d0e11362src" href="#d0e11362" class="noteref">4</a> describes them as &#8220;Wandering mendicants, sometimes suspected of associating with Kaik&#257;ris for purposes of crime; but they
seem nevertheless to be a comparatively harmless people. They travel about in little huts like those used by the Waddars;
the men occasionally sell buffaloes and milk; the women beg, singing and accompanying themselves on the <i>th&#257;li</i>. The old men also beg, carrying a flag in their hand, and shouting the name of their god, Hari Vithal (from which they derive
their name of Hard&#257;s). They are fond of spirits, and, when drunk, become pot-valiant and troublesome.&#8221; The <i>th&#257;li</i> or plate on which their women play is also known as <i>sarth&#257;da</i>, and consists of a small brass dish coated with <a id="d0e11376"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11376">440</a>]</span>wax in the centre; this is held on the thigh and a pointed stick is moved in a circle so as to produce a droning sound. The
men sometimes paint their own pictures, and in Bombay they have a caste rule that every Chitrakathi must have in his house
a complete set of sacred pictures; this usually includes forty representations of R&#257;ma&#8217;s life, thirty-five of that of the
sons of Arjun, forty of the P&#257;ndavas, forty of S&#299;ta and R&#257;wan, and forty of Harishchandra. The men also have sets of puppets
representing the above and other deities, and enact scenes with them like a Punch and Judy show, sometimes aided by ventriloquism.

</span><h2>Cutchi</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11381">
<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Cutchi</b> or <b>Meman, Kachhi, Muamin.</b>&#8212;A class of Muhammadan merchants who come every year from Gujar&#257;t and Cutch to trade in the towns of the Central Provinces,
where they reside for eight months, returning to their houses during the four months of the rainy season. In 1911 they numbered
about 2000 persons, of whom five-sixths were men, this fact indicating the temporary nature of their settlements. Nevertheless
a large proportion of the trade of the Province is in their hands. The caste is fully and excellently described by Kh&#257;n Bah&#257;dur
Fazalullah Lutfullah Far&#299;di, Assistant Collector of Customs, Bombay, in the <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i>.<a id="d0e11394src" href="#d0e11394" class="noteref">1</a> He remarks of them: &#8220;As shopkeepers and miscellaneous dealers Cutchis are considered to be the most successful of Muhammadans.
They owe their success in commerce to their freedom from display and their close and personal attention to and keen interest
in business. The richest Meman merchant does not disdain to do what a P&#257;rsi in his position would leave to his clerks. Their
hope and courage are also excellent endowments. They engage without fear in any promising new branch of trade and are daring
in their ventures, a trait partly inherited from their Loh&#257;na ancestors, and partly due to their faith in the luck which the
favour of their saints secures them.<span id="d0e11400" class="corr" title="Source: &#8217;">&#8221;</span> Another great advantage arises from their method of trading in small corporations or companies of a number of persons either
relations or friends. Some of these will have shops in the great centres of trade, Bombay and Calcutta, and others in <a id="d0e11403"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11403">441</a>]</span>different places in the interior. Each member then acts as correspondent and agent for all the others, and puts what business
he can in their way. Many are also employed as assistants and servants in the shops; but at the end of the season, when all
return to their native Gujar&#257;t, the profits from the different shops are pooled and divided among the members in varying proportion.
By this method they obtain all the advantages which are recognised as attaching to co-operative trading.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11405">
<h3>2. Origin of the caste.</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Far&#299;di, from whose description the remainder of this article is mainly taken, the Memans or more correctly
Muamins or &#8216;Believers&#8217; are converts from the Hindu caste of Loh&#257;nas of Sind. They venerate especially Maul&#257;na Abdul K&#257;dir
G&#299;l&#257;ni who died at Baghd&#257;d in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1165. His sixth descendant, Syed Y&#363;sufudd&#299;n Kordiri, was in 1421 instructed in a dream to proceed to Sind and guide its people
into the way of Isl&#257;m. On his arrival he was received with honour by the local king, who was converted, and the ruler&#8217;s example
was followed by one M&#257;nikji, the head of one of the <i>nukhs</i> or clans of the Loh&#257;na community. He with his three sons and seven hundred families of the caste embraced Isl&#257;m, and on their
conversion the title of Muamin or &#8216;Believer&#8217; was conferred on them by the saint. It may be noted that Colonel Tod derives
the Loh&#257;nas from the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, remarking of them:<a id="d0e11416src" href="#d0e11416" class="noteref">2</a> &#8220;This tribe is numerous both in Dh&#257;t and Talp&#363;ra; formerly they were R&#257;jp&#363;ts, but betaking themselves to commerce have fallen
into the third class. They are scribes and shopkeepers, and object to no occupation that will bring a subsistence; and as
to food, to use the expressive idiom of this region where hunger spurns at law, &#8216;Excepting their cats and their cows they
will eat anything.&#8217;&#8221; In his account of Sind, Postans says of the Loh&#257;nas: &#8220;The Hindu merchants and bankers have agents in
the most remote parts of Central Asia and could negotiate bills upon Candah&#257;r, Khel&#257;t, C&#257;bul, Khiva, Her&#257;t, Bokh&#257;ra or any
other marts of that country. These agents, in the pursuit of their calling, leave Sind for many years, quitting their families
to locate themselves among the most savage and intolerant <a id="d0e11421"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11421">442</a>]</span>tribes.&#8221; This account could equally apply to the Khatris, who also travel over Central Asia, as shown in the article on that
caste; and if, as seems not improbable, the Loh&#257;nas and Khatris are connected, the hypothesis that the former, like the latter,
are derived from R&#257;jp&#363;ts would receive some support.

</p>
<p>The present P&#299;r or head of the community is Sayyid J&#257;fir Sh&#257;h, who is nineteenth in descent from Y&#363;sufudd&#299;n and lives partly
in Bombay and partly in Mundra of South Cutch. &#8220;At an uncertain date,&#8221; Mr. Far&#299;di continues, &#8220;the Loh&#257;na or Cutchi Memans
passed from Cutch south through K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r to Gujar&#257;t. They are said to have been strong and wealthy in Surat during the period
of its prosperity (1580&#8211;1680). As Surat sank the Cutchi Memans moved to Bombay. Outside Cutch and K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r, which may be
considered their homes, the Memans are scattered over the cities of north and south Gujar&#257;t and other Districts of Bombay.
Beyond that Presidency they have spread as traders and merchants and formed settlements in Calcutta, Madras, the Malabar Coast,
South Burma, Siam, Singapore and Java; in the ports of the Arabian Peninsula, except Muscat, where they have been ousted by
the Khojas; and in Mozambique, Zanzibar and the East African Coast.&#8221;<a id="d0e11425src" href="#d0e11425" class="noteref">3</a> They have two divisions in Bombay, known as Cutchi or Kachhi and Halai.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11429">
<h3>3. Social customs.</h3>
<p>Cutchis and Memans retain some non-Muhammadan usages. The principal of these is that they do not allow their daughters and
widows to inherit according to the rule of Muhammadan law.<a id="d0e11434src" href="#d0e11434" class="noteref">4</a> They conduct their weddings by the Nik&#257;h form and the <i>mehar</i> or dowry is always the same sum of a hundred and twenty-five rupees, whatever may be the position of the parties and in the
case of widows also. <a id="d0e11443"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11443">443</a>]</span>They say that either party may be divorced by the other for conjugal infidelity, but the <i>mehar</i> or dowry must always be paid to the wife in the case of a divorce. The caste eat flesh and fowls and abstain from liquor.
Most of them also decline to eat beef as a consequence of their Hindu ancestry and they will not take food from Hindus of
low caste.

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="d0e11434" href="#d0e11434src" class="noteref">4</a></span> In recording this point Mr. Far&#299;di gives the following note: &#8220;In 1847 a case occurred which shows how firmly the Memans cling
to their original tribal customs. The widow of H&#257;ji N&#363;r Muhammad of the Lakariya family demanded a share of her deceased husband&#8217;s
property according to Muhammadan law. The <i>jam&#257;-at</i> or community decided that a widow had no claim to share her husband&#8217;s estates under the Hindu law. Before the High Court,
in spite of the ridicule of other Sunnis, the elders of the Cutchi Memans declared that their caste rules denied the widow&#8217;s
claim. The matter caused and is still (1896) causing agitation, as the doctors of the Sunni law at Mecca have decided that
as the law of inheritance is laid down by the holy Kor&#257;n, a wilful departure from it is little short of apostasy. The Memans
are contemplating a change, but so far they have not found themselves able to depart from their tribal practices.&#8221;

<h3>1. Origin of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Dah&#257;it, Dah&#257;yat.</b>&#8212;A mixed caste of village watchmen of the Jubbulpore and Mandla Districts, who are derived from the cognate caste of Khang&#257;rs
and from several of the forest tribes. In 1911 the Dah&#257;its numbered about 15,000 persons in the Central Provinces, of whom
the large majority were found in the Jubbulpore District and the remainder in Bil&#257;spur, Damoh and Seoni. Outside the Province
they reside only in Bundelkhand. According to one story the Dah&#257;its and Khang&#257;rs had a common ancestor, and in Mandla again
they say that their ancestors were the door-keepers of the R&#257;jas of Mahoba, and were known as Chhad&#299;dar or Darw&#257;n; and they
came to Mandla about 200 years ago, during the time of R&#257;ja Niz&#257;m Sh&#257;h of the R&#257;j-Gond dynasty of that place. In Mandla the
names of their subdivisions are given as Rawatia or Rautia, Kol, Maw&#257;si, Sonw&#257;ni and Rajw&#257;ria. Of these Kol and Rajw&#257;r are
the names of separate tribes; Maw&#257;si is commonly used as a synonym for Korku, another tribe; Sonw&#257;ni is the name of a sept
found among several of the primitive tribes; while R&#257;wat is a title borne by the Saonrs and Gonds. The names Rautia and Rajw&#257;ria
are found as subdivisions of the Kol tribe in M&#299;rz&#257;pur,<a id="d0e11499src" href="#d0e11499" class="noteref">2</a> and it is not improbable that the <a id="d0e11505"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11505">445</a>]</span>Dah&#257;its are principally derived from this tribe. The actual name Dah&#257;it is also given by Mr. Crooke as a subdivision of the
Kols, and he states it to have the meaning of &#8216;villager,&#8217; from <i>deh&#257;t</i>, a village. The Dah&#257;its were a class of personal attendants on the chief or R&#257;ja, as will be seen subsequently. They stood
behind the royal cushion and fanned him, ran in front of his chariot or litter to clear the way, and acted as door-keepers
and ushers. Service of this kind is of a menial nature and, further, demands a considerable degree of physical robustness;
and hence members of the non-Aryan forest tribes would naturally be selected for it. And it would appear that these menial
servants gradually formed themselves into a caste in Bundelkhand and became the Dah&#257;its. They obtained a certain rise in status,
and now rank in the position of village menials above their parent tribes. In the Central Provinces the Dah&#257;its have commonly
been employed as village watchmen, a post analogous to that of door-keeper or porter. The caste are also known as Bh&#257;ld&#257;r
or spearmen, and Kotw&#257;r or village watchmen.

<h3>2. Internal structure: totemism.</h3>
<p>The subcastes returned from the Mandla District have already been mentioned. In Bil&#257;spur they have quite different ones, of
which two, Joharia and Pailagia, are derived from methods of greeting. Joh&#257;r is the salutation which a R&#257;jp&#363;t prince sends
to a vassal or chief of inferior rank, and Pailagi or &#8216;I fall at your feet&#8217; is that with which a member of a lower caste accosts
a Br&#257;hman. How such names came to be adopted as subcastes cannot be explained. The caste have a number of exogamous groups
named after plants and animals. Members of the Bel,<a id="d0e11515src" href="#d0e11515" class="noteref">3</a> Rusallo and Chheola<a id="d0e11519src" href="#d0e11519" class="noteref">4</a> septs revere the trees after which these septs are named. They will not cut or injure the tree, and at the time of marriage
they go and invite it to be present at the ceremony. They offer to the tree the <i>maihar</i> cake, which is given only to the members of the family and the husbands and children of daughters. Those belonging to the
Nagotia sept<a id="d0e11526src" href="#d0e11526" class="noteref">5</a> will not kill a snake, and at the time of marriage they deposit the <i>maihar</i> cake at a snake-hole. Members of the Singh (lion) and B&#257;gh (tiger) septs will not <a id="d0e11534"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11534">446</a>]</span>kill a tiger, and at their weddings they draw his image on a wall and offer the cake to it, being well aware that if they
approached the animal himself, he would probably repudiate the relationship and might not be satisfied with the cake for his
meal.

<h3>3. Marriage and other customs.</h3>
<p>Prior to a marriage a bride-price, known as <i>sukh</i> or <i>ch&#257;ri</i>, and consisting of six rupees with some sugar, turmeric and sesamum oil, must be paid by the parents of the bridegroom to
those of the bride; and in the absence of this they will decline to perform the ceremony. At the wedding the couple go round
the sacred post, and then the bridegroom mingles the flames of two burning lamps and pierces the nose of the image of a bullock
made in flour. This rite is performed by several castes, and is said to be in commemoration of Krishna&#8217;s having done so on
different occasions. It is probably meant to excuse or legitimise the real operation, which should properly be considered
as sinful in view of the sacred character of the animal. And it may be mentioned here that the people of the Vindhyan or Bundelkhand
Districts where the Dah&#257;its live do not perforate the nostrils of bullocks, and drive them simply by a rope tied round the
mouth. In consequence they have little control over them and are quite unable to stop a cart going downhill, which simply
proceeds at the will of the animals until it reaches the level or bangs up against some obstacle. In Bil&#257;spur a widow is expected
to remain single for five years after her husband&#8217;s death, and if she marries within that time she is put out of caste. Divorce
is permitted, but is not of frequent occurrence. The caste will excuse a married woman caught in adultery once, but on a second
offence she must be expelled. If a woman leaves her husband and goes to live with another man, the latter must repay to her
husband the amount expended on his marriage. But in such a case, if the woman was already a widow or <i lang="und">kari aurat</i>,<a id="d0e11550src" href="#d0e11550" class="noteref">6</a> no penalty is incurred by a man who takes her from her second husband. A man of any good cultivating caste who has a <i>liaison</i> with a Dah&#257;it woman will be admitted into the community. An outsider who desires to become a member of the caste must clean
his house, break <a id="d0e11556"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11556">447</a>]</span>his earthen cooking-pots and buy new ones, and give a meal to the caste-fellows at his house. He sits and takes food with
them, and when the meal is over he takes a grain of rice from the leaf-plate of each guest and eats it, and drinks a drop
of water from his leaf-cup. This act is equivalent to eating the leavings of food, and after it he cannot re-enter his own
caste. On such occasions a rupee and a piece of cloth must be given to the headman of the caste, and a piece of cloth to each
member of the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee. The headman is known as Mirdh&#257;n, and a member of the committee as Diw&#257;n, the offices of both being hereditary.
The caste worship the Hindu and village gods of the locality. They have a curious belief that the skull of a man of the K&#257;yasth
(writer) caste cannot be burnt in fire, and that if it is placed in a dwelling-house the inmates will quarrel. A child&#8217;s first
teeth, if found, are thrown into a sacred river or on to the roof of a house with a few grains of rice, in order that the
second teeth may grow white and pointed like the rice. The Jh&#257;lar or first hair of a boy or girl is cut between two and ten
years of age and is wrapped in a piece of dough and thrown into a sacred river. Women are tattooed on the back of the hands,
and also sometimes on the shoulder and the arms above the elbow, but not on the feet or face.

<h3>4. Social position.</h3>
<p>The Dah&#257;its are now commonly employed as village watchmen and as guards or porters (<i>chaukid&#257;r</i>) of houses. In Bil&#257;spur they also carry litters and work as navvies and stonebreakers like the Kols. Here they will eat pork,
but in Jubbulpore greater regard is paid to Hindu prejudice, and they have given up pork and fowls and begun to employ Br&#257;hmans
for their ceremonies. The men of the caste will accept cooked food from any man of the higher castes or those cultivators
from whom a Br&#257;hman will take water, but the women are more strict and will only accept it from a Br&#257;hman, Bania, Lodhi or
Kurmi.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11569">
<h3>5. Former occupations: door-keeper and mace-bearer.</h3>
<p>In past times the Dah&#257;its were the personal attendants on the king. They fanned him with the <i>chaur</i> or yak-tail whisk when he sat in state on the royal cushion. This implement is held sacred and is also used by Br&#257;hmans to
fan the deities. On ordinary occasions the R&#257;ja was fanned by a pankha made of <i>khaskhas</i> grass and wetted, but not so that <a id="d0e11580"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11580">448</a>]</span>the water fell on his head. They also acted as gate-keepers of the palace, and had the title of Darw&#257;n. The gate-keeper&#8217;s
post was a responsible one, as it lay on him to see that no one with evil intentions or carrying secret arms was admitted
to the palace. Whenever a chief or noble came to visit the king he deposited his arms with the porter or door-keeper. The
necessity of a faithful door-keeper is shown in the proverb: &#8220;With these five you must never quarrel: your Guru, your wife,
your gate-keeper, your doctor and your cook.&#8221; The reasons for the inclusion of the others are fairly clear. On the other hand
the gate-porter had usually to be propitiated before access was obtained to his master, like the modern chupr&#257;ssie; and the
resentment felt at his rapacity is shown in the proverb: &#8220;The broker, the octroi moharrir, the door-keeper and the bard: these
four will surely go to hell.&#8221; The Darw&#257;n or door-keeper would be given the right to collect dues, equivalent to those of a
village watchman, from forty or fifty villages. The Dah&#257;its also carried the <i>chob</i> or silver mace before the king. This was about five feet long with a knob at the upper end as thick as a man&#8217;s wrist. The
mace-bearer was known as Chobd&#257;r, and it was his duty to carry messages and announce visitors; this latter function he performed
with a degree of pomposity truly Asiatic, dwelling with open mouth very audibly on some of the most sounding and emphatic
syllables in a way that appeared to strangers almost ludicrous,<a id="d0e11585src" href="#d0e11585" class="noteref">7</a> as shown in the following instance: &#8220;On advancing, the Chobd&#257;rs or heralds proclaimed the titles of this princely cow-keeper
in the usual hyperbolical style. One of the most insignificant-looking men I ever saw then became the destroyer of nations,
the leveller of mountains, the exhauster of the ocean. After commanding every inferior mortal to make way for this exalted
prince, the heralds called aloud to the animal creation, &#8216;Retire, ye serpents; fly, ye locusts; approach not, iguanas, lizards
and reptiles, while your lord and master condescends to set his foot on the earth.&#8217;&#8221;<a id="d0e11591src" href="#d0e11591" class="noteref">8</a> The Dah&#257;its ran before the R&#257;ja&#8217;s chariot or litter to clear the way for him and announce his coming; and it <a id="d0e11597"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11597">449</a>]</span>was also a principal business of the caste to carry the royal umbrella above the head of the king.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11599">
<h3>6. The umbrella.</h3>
<p>The umbrella was the essential symbol of sovereignty in Asia like the crown in Europe. &#8220;Among the ancient Egyptians the umbrella
carried with it a mark of distinction, and persons of quality alone could use it. The Assyrians reserved it for royal personages
only. The umbrella or parasol, says Layard, that emblem of royalty so universally adopted by Eastern nations, was generally
carried over the king in time of peace and sometimes even in war. In shape it resembled very closely those now in common use;
but it is always seen open in the sculptures. It was edged with tassels and usually decorated at the top by a flower or some
other ornament. The Greeks used it as a mystic symbol in some of their sacred festivals, and the Romans introduced the custom
of hanging an umbrella in the basilican churches as a part of the insignia of office of the judge sitting in the basilica.
It is said that on the judgment hall being turned into a church the umbrella remained, and in fact occupied the place of the
canopy over thrones and the like; and Beatian, an Italian herald, says that a vermilion umbrella in a field argent symbolises
dominion. It is also believed that the cardinal&#8217;s hat is a modification of the umbrella in the basilican churches. The king
of Burma is proud to call himself The Lord of Twenty-four Umbrellas, and the Emperor of China carries that number even to
the hunting-field.&#8221;<a id="d0e11604src" href="#d0e11604" class="noteref">9</a> In Buddhist architecture the &#8216;Wheel of Light&#8217; symbolising Buddha is overshadowed by an umbrella, itself adorned with garlands.
At S&#257;nchi we find sculptured representations of two and even three umbrellas placed one above the other over the temples,
the double and triple canopies of which appear to be fixed to the same handle or staff as in the modern state umbrellas of
China and Burma. Thus we have the primary idea of the accumulated honour of stone or metal discs which subsequently became
such a prominent feature of Buddhist architecture, culminating in the many-storied pagodas of China and Japan.<a id="d0e11610src" href="#d0e11610" class="noteref">10</a> Similarly in Hindu temples the pinnacle <a id="d0e11615"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11615">450</a>]</span>often stands on a circular stone base, probably representing an umbrella.

</p>
<p>The umbrella of state was apparently not black like its successor of commerce, but of white or another colour, though the
colour is seldom recorded. Sometimes it was of peacock&#8217;s feathers, the symbol of the Indian war-god, and as seen above, in
Italy it was of red, the royal colour. It has been suggested that the halo originally represented an umbrella, and there is
no reason to doubt that the umbrella was the parent of the state canopy.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11619">
<h3>7. Significance of the umbrella.</h3>
<p>It has been supposed that the reason for carrying the umbrella above the king&#8217;s head was to veil his eyes from his subjects,
and prevent them from being injured by the magical power of his glance.<a id="d0e11624src" href="#d0e11624" class="noteref">11</a> But its appearance on temples perhaps rather militates against this view. Possibly it may have merely served as a protection
or covering to the king&#8217;s head, the head being considered especially sacred as the seat of life. The same idea is perhaps
at the root of the objection felt by Hindus to being seen abroad without a covering on the head. It seems likely that the
umbrella may have been held to be a representation of the sky or firmament. The Muhammadans conjoined with it an <i>aft&#257;da</i> or sun-symbol; this was an imitation of the sun, embroidered in gold upon crimson velvet and fixed on a circular framework
which was borne aloft upon a gold or silver staff.<a id="d0e11633src" href="#d0e11633" class="noteref">12</a> Both were carried over the head of any royal personage, and the association favours the idea that the umbrella represents
the sky, while the king&#8217;s head might be considered analogous to the sun. When one of the early Indian monarchs made extensive
conquests, the annexed territories were described as being brought under his umbrella; of the king Harsha-Vardhana (606&#8211;648
<span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span>) it is recorded that he prosecuted a methodical scheme of conquest with the deliberate object of bringing all India under
one umbrella, that is, of constituting it into one state. This phrase seems to support the idea that the umbrella symbolised
the firmament. Similarly, when Visv&#257;mitra sent beautiful maidens to tempt the good king Harischandra he instructed <a id="d0e11641"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11641">451</a>]</span>them to try and induce the king to marry them, and if he would not do this, to ask him for the Puchukra Undi or State Umbrella,
which was the emblem of the king&#8217;s protecting power over his kingdom, with the idea that that power would be destroyed by
its loss. Chhatrapati or Lord of the Umbrella was the proudest title of an Indian king. When Sivaji was enthroned in 1674
he proclaimed himself as Pinnacle of the Kshatriya race and Lord of the Royal Umbrella. All these instances seem to indicate
that some powerful significance, such as that already suggested, attached to the umbrella. Several tribes, as the Gonds and
Mundas, have a legend that their earliest king was born of poor parents, and that one day his mother, having left the child
under some tree while she went to her work, returned to find a cobra spreading its hood over him. The future royal destiny
of the boy was thus predicted. It is commonly said that the cobra spread its hood over the child to guard it from the heat
of the sun, but such protection would perhaps scarcely seem very important to such a people as the Gonds, and the mother would
naturally also leave the child in the shade. It seems a possible hypothesis that the cobra&#8217;s hood really symbolised the umbrella,
the principal emblem of royal rank, and it was in this way that the child&#8217;s great destiny was predicted. In this connection
it may be noticed that one of the Jain Tirthak&#257;rs, P&#257;rasn&#257;th, is represented in sculpture with an umbrella over his head;
but some Jains say that the carving above the saint&#8217;s head is not an umbrella but a cobra&#8217;s hood. Even after it had ceased
to be the exclusive appanage of the king, the umbrella was a sign of noble rank, and not permitted to the commonalty.

</p>
<p>The old Anglo-Indian term for an umbrella was &#8216;roundel,&#8217; an early English word, applied to a variety of circular objects,
as a mat under a dish, or a target, and in its form of &#8216;arundel&#8217; to the conical handguard on a lance.<a id="d0e11645src" href="#d0e11645" class="noteref">13</a> An old Indian writer says: &#8220;Roundels are in these warm climates very necessary to keep the sun from scorching a man, they
may also be serviceable to keep the rain off; most men of account maintain one, two or three roundeliers, whose office is
only to attend their master&#8217;s motion; they are very <a id="d0e11650"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11650">452</a>]</span>light but of exceeding stiffness, being for the most part made of rhinoceros hide, very decently painted and guilded with
what flowers they best admire. Exactly in the midst thereof is fixed a smooth handle made of wood, by which the Roundelier
doth carry it, holding it a foot or more above his master&#8217;s head, directing the centre thereof as opposite to the sun as possibly
he may. Any man whatever that will go to the charge of it, which is no great matter, may have one or more Katysols to attend
him but not a Roundel; unless he be a Governor or one of the Council. The same custom the English hold good amongst their
own people, whereby they may be distinguished by the natives.&#8221;<a id="d0e11652src" href="#d0e11652" class="noteref">14</a> The Katysol was a Chinese paper and bamboo sunshade, and the use of them was not prohibited. It was derived from the Portuguese
<i>quito-sol</i>, or that which keeps off the sun.<a id="d0e11661src" href="#d0e11661" class="noteref">15</a> An extract from the <i>Madras Standing Orders</i>, 1677&#8211;78, prescribed: &#8220;That except by the members of this Council, those that have formerly been in that quality, Chiefs
of Factories, Commanders of Ships out of England, and the Chaplains, Rundells shall not be worn by any men in this town, and
by no woman below the degree of Factors&#8217; Wives and Ensigns&#8217; Wives, except by such as the Governor shall permit.&#8221;<a id="d0e11669src" href="#d0e11669" class="noteref">16</a> Another writer in 1754 states: &#8220;Some years before our arrival in the country, they (the E. I. Co.) found such sumptuary laws
so absolutely necessary, that they gave the strictest orders that none of these young gentlemen should be allowed even to
hire a Roundel boy, whose business it is to walk by his master and defend him with his Roundel or umbrella from the heat of
the sun. A young fellow of humour, upon this last order coming over, altered the form of his Umbrella from a round to a square,
called it a Squaredel instead of a Roundel, and insisted that no order yet in force forbade him the use of it.&#8221;<a id="d0e11674src" href="#d0e11674" class="noteref">17</a> The fact that the Anglo-Indians called the umbrella a roundel and regarded it as a symbol of sovereignty or nobility indicates
that it was not yet used in England; and this Mr. Skeat shows to be correct. &#8220;The first umbrella used in England by a man
in <a id="d0e11678"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11678">453</a>]</span>the open street for protection against rain is usually said to have been that carried by Jonas Hanway, a great traveller,
who introduced it on his return from Paris about 1750, some thirty years before it was generally adopted.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Some kind of umbrella was, however, occasionally used by ladies at least so far back as 1709; and a fact not generally known
is that from about the year 1717 onwards, a &#8216;parish&#8217; umbrella, resembling the more recent &#8216;family&#8217; umbrella of the nineteenth
century, was employed by the priest at open-air funerals, as the church accounts of many places testify.&#8221;<a id="d0e11682src" href="#d0e11682" class="noteref">18</a> This ecclesiastical use of the umbrella may have been derived from its employment as a symbol in Italian churches, as seen
above. The word umbrella is derived through the Italian from the Latin <i>umbra</i>, shade, and in mediaeval times a state umbrella was carried over the Doge or Duke at Venice on the occasion of any great
ceremony.<a id="d0e11691src" href="#d0e11691" class="noteref">19</a>

</p>
<p>Even recently it is said that in Saugor no Bania dare go past a Bundela R&#257;jp&#363;t&#8217;s house without getting down from his pony
and folding up his umbrella. In Hindu slang a &#8216;Chhataw&#257;li&#8217; or carrier of an umbrella was a term for a smart young man; as
in the line, &#8216;An umbrella has two kinds of ribs; two women are quarrelling for the love of him who carries it.&#8217; Now that the
umbrella is free to all, and may be bought for a rupee or less in the baz&#257;r, the prestige which once attached to it has practically
disappeared. But some flavour of its old associations may still cling to it in the minds of the sais and ayah who proudly
parade to a festival carrying umbrellas spread over them to shade their dusky features from the sun; though the R&#257;ja, in obedience
to the dictates of fashion, has discarded the umbrella for a <i>sola-topi</i>.

<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Daharia.</b><a id="d0e11711src" href="#d0e11711" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A caste of degraded R&#257;jp&#363;ts found in Bil&#257;spur and Raipur, and numbering about 2000 persons. The <a id="d0e11714"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11714">454</a>]</span>Daharias were originally a clan of R&#257;jp&#363;ts but, like several others in the Central Provinces, they have now developed into
a caste and marry among themselves, thus transgressing the first rule of R&#257;jp&#363;t exogamy. Colonel Tod included the Daharias
among the thirty-six royal races of R&#257;jasth&#257;n.<a id="d0e11716src" href="#d0e11716" class="noteref">2</a> Their name is derived from D&#257;har or D&#257;hal, the classical term for the Jubbulpore country at the period when it formed the
dominion of the Haihaya or K&#257;lachuri R&#257;jp&#363;t kings of Tripura or Tewar near Jubbulpore. This dynasty had an era of their own,
commencing in <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 248, and their line continued until the tenth or eleventh century. The Arabian geographer Alberuni (born <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 973) mentions the country of D&#257;hal and its king G&#257;ngeya Deva. His son Karna Daharia is still remembered as the builder of
temples in Karanbel and Bilahri in Jubbulpore, and it is from him that the Daharia R&#257;jp&#363;ts take their name. The Haihaya dynasty
of Ratanpur were related to the K&#257;lachuri kings of Tewar, and under them the ancestors of the Daharia R&#257;jp&#363;ts probably migrated
from Jubbulpore into Chhatt&#299;sgarh. But they themselves have forgotten their illustrious origin, and tell a different story
to account for their name. They say that they came from Baghelkhand or Rewah, which may well be correct, as Rewah lies between
Chhatt&#299;sgarh and Jubbulpore, and a large colony of K&#257;lachuri R&#257;jp&#363;ts may still be found about ten miles north-east of Rewah
town. The Daharias relate that when Parasur&#257;ma, the great Br&#257;hman warrior, was slaying the Kshatriyas, a few of them escaped
towards Ratanpur and were camping in the forest by the wayside. Parasur&#257;ma came up and asked them who they were, and they
said they were <i>Daharias</i> or wayfarers, from <i>d&#257;har</i> the Chhatt&#299;sgarhi term for a road or path; and thus they successfully escaped the vengeance of Parasur&#257;ma. This futile fiction
only demonstrates the real ignorance of their Br&#257;hman priests, who, if they had known a little history, need not have had
recourse to their invention to furnish the Daharias with a distinguished pedigree. A third derivation is from a word <i>dahri</i> or gate, and they say that the name of Dahria or Daharia was conferred on them by Bimbaji Bhonsla, because of the bravery
with which they held the gates of Ratanpur against his attack. But history <a id="d0e11737"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11737">455</a>]</span>is against them here, as it records that Ratanpur capitulated to the Mar&#257;thas without striking a blow.

<div class="div2" id="d0e11739">
<h3>2. Sept and subsept.</h3>
<p>As already stated, the Daharias were originally a clan of R&#257;jp&#363;ts, whose members must take wives or husbands from other clans.
They have now become a caste and marry among themselves, but within the caste they still have exogamous groups or septs, several
of which are named after R&#257;jp&#363;t clans as Bais, Chandel, Baghel, Bundela, Mainpuri Chauh&#257;n, Parih&#257;r, R&#257;thor and several others.
Certain names are not of R&#257;jp&#363;t origin, and probably record the admission of outsiders into the caste. Like the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, within
the sept they have also subsepts, some of which are taken from the Br&#257;hmans, as Par&#257;sar, Bh&#257;radw&#257;j, S&#257;ndilya, while others
are nicknames, as Kachariha (one who does not care about a beating), Atariha, Hiy&#257;s and others. The divisions of the septs
and subsepts are very confused, and seem to indicate that at different times various foreign elements have been received into
the community, including R&#257;jp&#363;ts of many different clans. According to rule, a man should not take a wife whose sept or subsept
are the same as his own, but this is not adhered to; and in some cases the Daharias, on account of the paucity of their numbers
and the difficulty of arranging matches, have been driven to permit the marriage of first cousins, which among proper R&#257;jp&#363;ts
is forbidden. They also practise hypergamy, as members of the Mainpuri Chauh&#257;n, Hiy&#257;s, Bisen, Surkhi and Bais septs or subsepts
will take girls in marriage from families of other septs, but will not give their daughters to them. This practice leads to
polygamy among the five higher septs, whose daughters are all married in their own circle, while in addition they receive
girls from the other groups. Members of these latter also consider it an honour to marry a daughter into one of the higher
septs, and are willing to pay a considerable price for such a distinction. It seems probable that the small Daraiha caste
of Bil&#257;spur are an inferior branch of the Daharias.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11744">
<h3>3. Social customs.</h3>
<p>The Daharias, in theory at any rate, observe the same rules in regard to their women as Br&#257;hmans and R&#257;jp&#363;ts. Neither divorce
nor the marriage of widows is permitted, and a woman who goes wrong is finally expelled from the <a id="d0e11749"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11749">456</a>]</span>caste. Their social customs resemble those of the higher Hindust&#257;ni castes. When the bridegroom starts for the wedding he
is dressed in a long white gown reaching to the ankles, with new shoes, and he takes with him a dagger; this serves the double
purpose of warding off evil spirits, always prone to attack the bridal party, and also of being a substitute for the bridegroom
himself, as in case he should for some unforeseen reason be rendered unable to appear at the ceremony, the bride could be
married to the dagger as his representative. It may also be mentioned that, before the bridegroom starts for the wedding,
after he has been rubbed with oil and turmeric for five days he is seated on a wooden plank over a hole dug in the courtyard
and bathed. He then changes his clothes, and the women bring twenty-one small <i>chukias</i> or cups full of water and empty them over him. His head is then covered with a piece of new cloth, and a thread wound round
it seven times by a Br&#257;hman. The thread is afterwards removed, and tied round an iron ring with some mango leaves, and this
ring forms the <i>kankan</i> which is tied to the bridegroom&#8217;s wrist, a similar one being worn by the bride. Before the wedding the bride goes round to
the houses of her friends, accompanied by the women of her party singing songs, and by musicians. At each house the mistress
appears with her forehead and the parting of her hair profusely smeared with vermilion. She rubs her forehead against the
bride&#8217;s so as to colour it also with vermilion, which is now considered the symbol of a long and happy married life. The barber&#8217;s
wife applies red paint to the bride&#8217;s feet, the gardener&#8217;s wife presents her with a garland of flowers, and the carpenter&#8217;s
wife gives her a new wooden doll. She must also visit the potter&#8217;s and washerman&#8217;s wives, whose benisons are essential; they
give her a new pot and a little rice respectively. When the bridegroom comes to touch the marriage-shed with his dagger he
is resisted by the bride&#8217;s sister, to whom he must give a rupee as a present. The binding portion of the marriage consists
in the couple walking seven times round the marriage-post. At each turn the bridegroom seizes the bride&#8217;s right toe and with
it upsets one of seven little cups of rice placed near the marriage-post. This is probably a <a id="d0e11757"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11757">457</a>]</span>symbol of fertility. After it they worship seven pairs of little wooden boxes smeared with vermilion and called <i>singhora</i> and <i>singhori</i> as if they were male and female. The bridegroom&#8217;s father brings two little dough images of Mah&#257;deo and P&#257;rvati as the ideal
married pair, and gives them to the couple. The new husband applies vermilion to his wife&#8217;s forehead, and covers and uncovers
her head seven times, to signify to her that, having become a wife, she should henceforth be veiled when she goes abroad.
The bride&#8217;s maid now washes her face, which probably requires it, and the wedding is complete. The Daharias usually have a
<i>guru</i> or spiritual preceptor, but husband and wife must not have the same one, as in that case they would be in the anomalous position
of brother and sister, a <i>guru&#8217;s</i> disciples being looked upon as his children. The Daharias were formerly warriors in the service of the Ratanpur kings, and
many families still possess an old sword which they worship on the day of Dasahra. Their names usually end in Singh or L&#257;l.
They are now engaged in cultivation, and many of them are proprietors of villages, and tenants. Some of them are employed
as constables and chupr&#257;ssies, but few are labourers, as they may not touch the plough with their own hands. They eat the
flesh of clean animals, but do not drink liquor, and avoid onions and tomatoes. They have good features and fair complexions,
the traces of their R&#257;jp&#363;t blood being quite evident. Br&#257;hmans will take water from them, but they now rank below R&#257;jp&#363;ts,
on a level with the good cultivating castes.

</span><h2>D&#257;ngi</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11774">
<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>D&#257;ngi.</b>&#8212;A cultivating caste found almost exclusively in the Saugor District, which contained 23,000 persons out of a total of 24,000
of the caste in the Central Provinces in 1911. There are also considerable numbers of them in R&#257;jput&#257;na and Central India,
from which localities they probably immigrated into the Saugor District during the eleventh century. The D&#257;ngis were formerly
dominant in Saugor, a part of which was called D&#257;ngiw&#257;ra after them. The kings of Garhpahra or old Saugor were D&#257;ngis, and
their family still remains at the village of Bilehra, which with a few other villages they hold as a revenue-free grant. <a id="d0e11781"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11781">458</a>]</span>The name of the caste is variously derived. The traditional story is that the R&#257;jp&#363;t king of Garhpahra detained the palanquins
of twenty-two married women of different castes and kept them as his wives. The issue of the illicit intercourse were named
D&#257;ngis, and there are thus twenty-two subdivisions of the caste, besides three other subdivisions who are held to be descended
from pure R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The name is said to be derived from <i>d&#257;ng</i>, fraud, on account of the above deception. A more plausible derivation is from the Persian <i>d&#257;ng</i>, a hill, the D&#257;ngis being thus hillmen; and they may not improbably have been a set of robbers and freebooters in the Vindhyan
Hills, like the G&#363;jars and Mew&#257;tis in northern India, naturally recruiting their band from all classes of the population,
as is shown by ingenious implication in this story itself. &#8216;<i>Khet men b&#257;mi, gaon men D&#257;ngi</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;A D&#257;ngi in the village is like the hole of a snake in one&#8217;s field&#8217; is a proverb which shows the estimation in which
they were formerly held. The three higher septs may have been their leaders and may well have been R&#257;jp&#363;ts. Since they have
settled down as respectable cultivators and enjoy a good repute among their neighbours, the D&#257;ngis have disowned the above
story, and now say that they are descended from R&#257;ja D&#257;ng, a Kachhw&#257;ha R&#257;jp&#363;t king of Narwar in Central India. Nothing is
known of R&#257;ja D&#257;ng except a rude couplet which records how he was cheated by a horse-dealer:


</p>
<div class="poem" lang="und">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>Jitki ghori tit gayi
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>D&#257;ng h&#257;th kary&#257;ri rahi,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&#8216;The mare bolted to the seller again, leaving in D&#257;ng&#8217;s hand nothing except the reins.&#8217;

</p>
<p>The D&#257;ngis have a more heroic version of this story to the effect that the mare was a fairy of Indra&#8217;s court, who for some
reason had been transformed into this shape and was captured by R&#257;ja D&#257;ng. He refused to give her up to Indra and a battle
was about to ensue, when the mare besought them to place her on a pyre and sacrifice her instead of fighting. They agreed
to do this, and out of the flames of the pyre the fairy emerged and floated up to heaven, leaving only the reins and bridle
of the mare in R&#257;ja D&#257;ng&#8217;s hand. <a id="d0e11801"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11801">459</a>]</span>Yet a third story is that their original ancestor was R&#257;ja Nip&#257;l Singh of Narwar, and when he was fighting with Indra over
the fairy, Krishna came to Indra&#8217;s assistance. But Nip&#257;l Singh refused to bow down to Krishna, and being annoyed at this and
wishing to teach him a lesson the god summoned him to his court. At the gate through which Nip&#257;l Singh had to pass, Krishna
fixed a sword at the height of a man&#8217;s neck, so that he must bend or have his head cut off. But Nip&#257;l Singh saw the trick,
and, sitting down, propelled himself through the doorway with his head erect. The outwitted god remarked, &#8216;<i lang="und">Tum bare d&#257;ndi ho</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;You are very cunning,&#8217; and the name D&#257;ndi stuck to Nip&#257;l Singh and was afterwards corrupted to D&#257;ngi. There can be
little doubt that the caste are an offshoot of R&#257;jp&#363;ts of impure blood, and with a large admixture of other classes of the
population. Some of their sept names indicate their mixed descent, as Rakhya, born of a potter woman, Dhoniya, born of a washerwoman,
and Pavniya, born of a weaver woman. In past times the D&#257;ngis served in the R&#257;jp&#363;t and Mar&#257;tha armies, and a small isolated
colony of them is found in one village of Indora in the N&#257;gpur District, the descendants of D&#257;ngis who engaged in military
service under the Bhonsla kings.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11806">
<h3>2. Caste subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The D&#257;ngis have no subcastes distinguished by separate names, but they are divided into three classes, among whom the principle
of hypergamy prevails. As already seen, there were formerly twenty-five clans, of whom the three highest, the Nahonias, Bhadonias
and Nadias, claimed to be pure R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The other twenty-two clans are known as Ba&#299;sa (22) or Prithwipat D&#257;ngis, after the
king who is supposed to have been the ancestor of all the clans. Each of his twenty-two wives is said to have been given a
village for her maintenance, and the clans are named after these villages. But there are now only thirteen of these local
clans left, and below them is a miscellaneous group of clans, representing apparently later accretions to the caste. Some
of them are named from the places from which they came, as Mahobia, from Mahoba, Narwaria, from Narwar, and so on. The Solakhia
sept is named after the Solanki R&#257;jp&#363;ts, of whom they may be the partly illegitimate descendants. The Parn&#257;mi sept are <a id="d0e11811"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11811">460</a>]</span>apparently those who have the creed of the Dh&#257;mis, the followers of Pr&#257;nn&#257;th of Panna. And as already seen, some are named
from women of low caste, from whom by D&#257;ngi fathers they are supposed to be descended. The whole number of septs is thus divided
into three groups, the highest containing the three quasi-R&#257;jp&#363;t septs already mentioned, the next highest the thirteen septs
of Prithwipat D&#257;ngis, and the lowest all the other septs. Pure R&#257;jp&#363;ts will take daughters in marriage from the highest group,
and this in turn takes girls of the Prithwipat D&#257;ngis of the thirteen clans, though neither will give daughters in return;
and the Prithwipat D&#257;ngis will similarly accept the daughters of the miscellaneous septs below them in marriage with their
sons. Matches are, however, not generally arranged according to the above system of hypergamy, but each group marries among
its own members. Girls who are married into a higher group have to be given a larger dowry, the fathers often being willing
to pay Rs. 500 or Rs. 1000 for the social distinction which such an alliance confers on the family. Among the highest septs
there is a further difference between those whose ancestors accepted food from R&#257;ja Jai Singh, the founder of Jaisinghnagar,
and those who refused it. The former are called Sakrodia or those who ate the leavings of others, and the latter <i>Deotaon ki sans&#257;r</i>, or the divine D&#257;ngis. Pure R&#257;jp&#363;ts will take daughters only from the members of the latter group in each sept. Marriage
within the sept or <i>baink</i> is prohibited, and as a rule a man does not marry a wife belonging to the same sept as his mother or grandmother. Marriage
by exchange also is not allowed, that is, a girl cannot be married into the same family as that in which her brother has married.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11819">
<h3>3. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Girls are generally married between seven and twelve and boys between ten and twenty, but no stigma attaches to a family allowing
an unmarried girl to exceed the age of puberty. The bridegroom should always be older than the bride. Matches are arranged
by the parents, the horoscopes of the children being compared among the well-to-do. The zodiacal sign of the boy&#8217;s horoscope
should be stronger than that of the girl&#8217;s, so that she may be submissive to <a id="d0e11824"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11824">461</a>]</span>him in after-life. Thus a girl whose zodiac sign is the lion should not be married to a boy whose sign is the ram, because
in that case the wife would dominate the husband. There is no special rule as to the time of the betrothal, and the ceremony
is very simple, consisting in the presentation of a cocoanut by the bride&#8217;s father to the bridegroom&#8217;s father, and the distribution
of sweets to the caste-fellows. The betrothal is not considered to have any particularly binding force and either party may
break through it. Among the D&#257;ngis a bridegroom-price is usually paid, which varies according to the social respectability
of the boy&#8217;s sept, as much as Rs. 2000 having been given for a bridegroom of higher class according to the rule of hypergamy
already described. But no value is placed on educational qualifications, as is the case among Br&#257;hmans and K&#257;yasths. The marriage
ceremony is conducted according to the ritual prevalent in the northern Districts, and presents no special features. Two feasts
are given by the bride&#8217;s father to the caste-fellows, one consisting of <i>katchi</i> food or that which is cooked with water, and another of <i>pakki</i> food cooked with <i>gh&#299;</i> (butter). If the bride is of marriageable age the <i>gauna</i> or sending away ceremony is performed at once, otherwise it takes place in the third or fifth year after marriage. At the
<i>gauna</i> ceremony the bride&#8217;s cloth is tied to that of the bridegroom, and they change seats. Widow-marriage is not fashionable, and
the caste say that it is not permitted, but several instances are known of its having occurred. Divorce is not allowed, and
a woman who goes wrong is finally expelled from the caste. Polygamy is allowed, and many well-to-do persons have more than
one wife.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11841">
<h3>4. Religious and social customs.</h3>
<p>The D&#257;ngis pay special reverence to the goddess Durga or Devi as the presiding deity of war. They worship her during the months
of Kunw&#257;r (September) and Chait (March), and at the same time pay reverence to their weapons of war, their swords and guns,
or if they have not got these, to knives and spears. They burn their dead, but children are usually buried. They observe mourning
for three days for a child and for ten days for an adult, and on the 13th day the caste-fellows are feasted. Their family
priests, who are <a id="d0e11846"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11846">462</a>]</span>Jijhotia Br&#257;hmans, used formerly to shave the head and beard when a death occurred among their clients as if they belonged
to the family, but this practice was considered derogatory by other Br&#257;hmans, and they have now stopped it. The D&#257;ngis perform
the <i>shr&#257;dhh</i> ceremony in the month of Kunw&#257;r. The caste wear the sacred thread, but it is said that they were formerly not allowed to
do so in Bundelkhand. They eat fish and flesh, including that of wild boars, but not fowls or beef, and they do not drink
liquor. They take <i>pakki</i> food or that cooked without water from K&#257;yasths and Gahoi Banias, and <i>katchi</i> food, cooked with water, from Jijhotia and San&#257;dhya Br&#257;hmans. Jijhotia Br&#257;hmans formerly took <i>pakki</i> food from D&#257;ngis, but have now ceased to do so. The D&#257;ngis require the services of Br&#257;hmans at all ceremonies. They have
a caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee. A person who changes his religion or eats with a low caste is permanently expelled, while temporary exclusion
is awarded for the usual delinquencies. In the case of the more serious offences, as murder or killing of a cow, the culprit
must purify himself by a pilgrimage to a sacred river.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11863">
<h3>5. Occupation and character.</h3>
<p>The D&#257;ngis were formerly, as already stated, of a quarrelsome temperament, but they have now settled down and, though spirited,
are of a good disposition, and hard-working cultivators. They rank slightly above the representative cultivating castes owing
to their former dominant position, and are still considered to have a good conceit of themselves, according to the saying:


</p>
<div class="poem" lang="und">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="line" style=""><span>Tin men neh terah men,
</span></p>
<p class="line" style=""><span>Mirdang baj&#257;we dere men,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or &#8216;Though he belong neither to the three septs nor the thirteen septs, yet the D&#257;ngi blows his own trumpet in his own house.&#8217;
They are still, too, of a fiery disposition, and it is said that the favourite dish of gram-flour cooked with curds, which
is known as <i>karhi</i>, is never served at their weddings. Because the word <i>karhi</i> also signifies the coming out of a sword from its sheath, and when addressed to another man has the equivalent of the English
word &#8216;Draw&#8217; in the duelling days. So if one D&#257;ngi said it to another, meaning to ask him for the dish, it might result in
<a id="d0e11881"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11881">463</a>]</span>a fight. They are very backward in respect of education and set no store by it. They consider their traditional occupation
to be military service, but nearly all of them are now engaged in agriculture. At the census of 1901 over 2000 were returned
as supported by the ownership of land and 3000 as labourers and farmservants. Practically all the remainder are tenants. They
are industrious, and their women work in the fields. The only crops which they object to grow are <i>kusum</i> or safflower and san-hemp. The Nahonia D&#257;ngis, being the highest subcaste, refuse to sell milk or <i>gh&#299;</i>. The men usually have Singh as a termination to their names, like R&#257;jp&#363;ts. Their dress and ornaments are of the type common
in the northern Districts. The women tattoo their bodies.

</span><h2>D&#257;ngri</h2>
<p><b>D&#257;ngri.</b><a id="d0e11895src" href="#d0e11895" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A small caste of melon and vegetable growers, whose name is derived from <i>d&#257;ngar</i> or <i>d&#257;ngra</i>, a water-melon. They reside in the Wardha and Bhand&#257;ra Districts, and numbered about 1800 persons in 1911. The caste is a
mixed one of functional origin, and appears to be an offshoot from the Kunbis with additions from other sources. In Wardha
they say that their ancestor was one of two brothers to whom Mah&#257;deo gave the seeds of a ju&#257;ri plant and a water-melon respectively
for sowing. The former became the ancestor of the Kunbis and the latter of the D&#257;ngris. On one occasion when Mah&#257;deo, assuming
the guise of a beggar, asked the D&#257;ngri brother for a water-melon, he refused to give it, and on this account his descendants
were condemned to perpetual poverty. In fact, the D&#257;ngris, like the other market-gardening castes, are badly off, possibly
on account of their common habit of marrying a number of wives, whom they utilise as labourers in their vegetable gardens;
for though a wife is better than a hired labourer for their particular method of cultivation, where supervision is difficult
and the master may be put to serious loss from bad work and petty pilfering, while there is also much scope for women workers;
yet on the other hand polygamy tends to the breeding of family quarrels and to <a id="d0e11904"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11904">464</a>]</span>excessive subdivision of property. The close personal supervision which is requisite perhaps also renders it especially difficult
to carry on the business of market-gardening on a large scale. In any case the agricultural holdings of the M&#257;lis and D&#257;ngris
are as a rule very small. The conclusion indicated by the above story that the D&#257;ngris are an offshoot from the Kunbi caste
of cultivators appears to be correct; and it is supported by the fact that they will accept food cooked with water from the
Baone Kunbis. But their subcastes show that even this small body is of very heterogeneous composition; for they are divided
into the Teli, the Kal&#257;r, the Kunbi and the G&#257;diw&#257;n D&#257;ngris, thus showing that the caste has received recruits from the Telis
or oilmen and the Kal&#257;rs or liquor-sellers. The G&#257;diw&#257;n, as their name denotes, are a separate section who have adopted the
comparatively novel occupation of cart-driving for a livelihood. In Wardha there is also a small class of P&#257;nibhar or waterman
D&#257;ngris who are employed as water-bearers, this occupation arising not unnaturally from that of growing melons and other crops
in river-beds. And a few members of the caste have taken to working in iron. The bulk of the D&#257;ngris, however, grow melons,
chillies and brinjals on the banks or in the beds of rivers; but as the melon crop is raised in a period of six weeks during
the hot season, they can also undertake some ordinary cultivation. When the melons ripen the first fruits are offered to Mah&#257;deo
and given to a Br&#257;hman to ensure the success of the crop. When the melon plants are in flower, a woman must not enter the
field during the period of her monthly impurity, as it is believed that she would cause the crop to wither. While it may safely
be assumed that the D&#257;ngris originated from the great Kunbi caste, it may be noted that some of them tell a story to the effect
that their original home was Ben&#257;res, and that they came from there into the Central Provinces; hence they call themselves
K&#257;shi D&#257;ngri, K&#257;shi being the classical name for Ben&#257;res. This legend appears to be entirely without foundation, as their
family names, speech and customs are alike of purely Mar&#257;thi origin. But it is found among other castes also that they like
to pretend that they came from Ben&#257;res, the most sacred centre of Hinduism. <a id="d0e11906"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11906">465</a>]</span>The social customs of the D&#257;ngris resemble those of the Kunbis, and it is unnecessary to describe them in detail. Before their
weddings they have a curious ceremony known as Dewat P&#363;ja. The father of the bridegroom, with an axe over his shoulder and
accompanied by his wife, goes to a well or a stream. Here they clean a small space with cow-dung and make an offering of rice,
flowers, turmeric and incense, after which the man, breaking his bangle from off his wrist, throws it into the water, apparently
as a propitiatory offering for the success of the marriage. It is not stated what the bangle is made of, but it may be assumed
that a valuable one would not thus be thrown away. As among some of the other Mar&#257;tha castes, the bridegroom must be wrapped
in a blanket on his journey to the bride&#8217;s village. If a bachelor desires to espouse a widow he must first go through the
ceremony of marriage with a swallow-wort plant. Polygamy is freely permitted, and some D&#257;ngris are known to have as many as
five wives. As already stated, wives are of great assistance in gardening work, which demands much hand-labour. Divorce and
the remarriage of widows are allowed. The D&#257;ngris commonly bury the dead, and they place cotton leaves over the eyes and ears
of the corpse. In Bhand&#257;ra they say that this is done when it is believed the dead person was possessed by an evil spirit,
and there is possibly some idea of preventing the escape of the spirit from the body. In Wardha the D&#257;ngris have rather a
bad reputation, and a saying current about them is &#8216;<i lang="und">D&#257;ngri beta puha chor</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;A D&#257;ngri will steal even a shred of cotton&#8217;; but this may be a libel.

<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Darzi, Shimpi, Chh&#299;pi, S&#363;ji.</b>&#8212;The occupational caste of tailors. In 1911 a total of 51,000 persons were returned as belonging to the caste in the Central
Provinces and Ber&#257;r. The Darzis are an urban caste and are most numerous in Districts with large towns. Mr. Crooke derives
the word Darzi from the Persian <i>darz</i>, meaning a seam. The name S&#363;ji from <i>sui</i>, a needle, was formerly more common. Shimpi is the Mar&#257;tha name, and Chh&#299;pi, from Chh&#299;pa a calico-printer or dyer, is another
name used for the caste, probably because it is largely recruited from the Chh&#299;pas. In Bombay they say that when Parasur&#257;ma
was destroying the Kshatriyas, two R&#257;jp&#363;t brothers hid themselves in a temple and were protected by the priest, who set one
of them to sew dresses for the idol and the other to dye and stamp them. The first brother was called Chh&#299;pi and from him
the Darzis are descended, the name being corrupted to Shimpi, and the second was called Chh&#299;pa and was the ancestor of the
dyers. The common title of the Darzis is Khal&#299;fa, an Arabic word meaning &#8216;The Successor of the Prophet.&#8217; Colonel Temple says
that it is not confined to them but is also used by barbers, cooks and monitors in schools.<a id="d0e11956src" href="#d0e11956" class="noteref">1</a> The caste is of comparatively recent formation. In fact Sir D. Ibbetson wrote<a id="d0e11961src" href="#d0e11961" class="noteref">2</a> that &#8220;Darzi, or its Hindi equivalent S&#363;ji, is purely <a id="d0e11966"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11966">467</a>]</span>an occupational term, and though there is a Darzi guild in every town, there is no Darzi caste in the proper acceptation of
the word. The greater number of Darzis belong perhaps to the Dhobi and Chh&#299;mba castes, more especially to the latter.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11968">
<h3>2. Subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The Darzis, however, are now recognised as a distinct caste, but their mixed origin is shown by the names of their subcastes
and exogamous sections. Thus they have a B&#257;man subdivision named after the Br&#257;hman caste. These will not take food from any
other caste except Br&#257;hmans and are probably an offshoot from them. They are considered to be the highest subdivision, and
next to them come the Rai or R&#257;j Darzis. Another subcaste is named Kaithia, after the K&#257;yasths, and a third Sriv&#257;stab, which
is the name of a well-known subcaste of K&#257;yasths derived from the town of Sr&#257;vasti, now Sahet Mahet in the Gonda District.<a id="d0e11973src" href="#d0e11973" class="noteref">3</a> In Bet&#363;l the Sriv&#257;stab Darzis are reported to forbid the remarriage of widows, thus showing that they desire to live up to
their distinguished ancestry. A third subcaste is known as Chamarua and appears to be derived from the Cham&#257;rs. Other subcastes
are of the territorial type as M&#257;lwi, Kh&#257;ndeshi, Chhatt&#299;sgarhi, Mathuria and so on, and the section or family names are usually
taken from villages. Among them, however, we find Jugia from Jogi, Th&#257;kur or R&#257;jp&#363;t, G&#363;jar, Khaw&#257;s or barber, and Baroni,
the title of a female Dh&#299;mar. Mr. Crooke gives several other names.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e11979">
<h3>3. Sewn clothes not formerly worn.</h3>
<p>It may thus reasonably be concluded that the Darzis are a caste of comparatively recent origin, and the explanation is probably
that the use of the needle and thread in making clothes is a new fashion. Buchanan remarks: &#8220;The needle indeed seems to have
been totally unknown to the Hindus, and I have not been able to learn any Hindi word for sewing except that used to express
passing the shuttle in the act of weaving....&#8221; &#8220;Cloth composed of several pieces sewn together is an abomination to the Hindus,
so that every woman of rank when she eats, cooks or prays, must lay aside her petticoat and retain only the wrapper made without
the use of scissors or needle&#8221;; and again, &#8220;The dress of the Hindu men of rank has become nearly the same with <a id="d0e11984"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e11984">468</a>]</span>that of the Muhammadans<a id="d0e11986src" href="#d0e11986" class="noteref">4</a> who did not allow any officer employed by them to appear at their <i>lev&eacute;es</i> (Durbars) except in proper dress. At home, however, the Hindu men, and on all occasions their women, retain almost entirely
their native dress, which consists of various pieces of cloth wrapped round them without having been sewn together in any
form, and only kept in their place by having their ends thrust under the folds.&#8221; And elsewhere he states: &#8220;The flowering of
cotton cloth with the needle has given a good deal of employment to the Muhammadan women of Maldeh as the needle has never
been used by the Hindus.&#8221;<a id="d0e11995src" href="#d0e11995" class="noteref">5</a> Darzi, as has been seen, is a Persian word, and in northern India many tailors are Muhammadans. And it seems, therefore,
a possible hypothesis that the needle and the art of sewing were brought into general use by the Moslem invaders. It is true
that in his <i>Indo-Aryans</i><a id="d0e12002src" href="#d0e12002" class="noteref">6</a> Mr. R&#257;jendra L&#257;l Mitra combats this hypothesis and demonstrates that made-up clothes were known to the Aryans of the Rig-Veda
and are found in early statuary. But he admits that the instances are not numerous, and it seems likely that the use of such
clothes may have been confined to royal and aristocratic families. It is possible also that the Scythian invasions of the
fifth century brought about a partial relapse from civilisation, during which certain arts and industries, and among them
that of cutting and sewing cloth, were partially or completely lost. The tailor is not the familiar figure in Hindu social
life that he is, for example, in England. Here he is traditionally an object or butt for ridicule as in the saying, &#8216;Nine
tailors make a man,&#8217; and so on; and his weakness is no doubt supposed to be due to the fact that he pursues a sedentary indoor
occupation and one more adapted to women than men, the needle being essentially a feminine implement. A similar ridicule,
based no doubt on exactly the same grounds, attaches in India to the village weaver, as is evidenced by the proverbs given
in the articles on Bhulia, Kori, and Jol&#257;ha. No reason exists probably for the contempt in which the weaver class is held
other than that their work is considered to be more fitting for women than men. Thus in India the <a id="d0e12005"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12005">469</a>]</span>weaver appears to take the place of the tailor, and this leads to the conclusion that woven and not sewn clothes have always
been commonly worn.

</p>
<p>In the Central Provinces, at least, the Darzi caste is practically confined to the towns, and though cotton jackets are worn
even by labourers and shirts by the better-to-do, these are usually bought ready-made at the more important markets. Women,
more conservative in their dress than men, have only one garment prepared with the needle, the small bodice known as <i>choli</i> or <i>angia</i>. And in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, a landlocked tract very backward in civilisation, the <i>choli</i> has hitherto not been worn and is only now being introduced. Though he first copied the Muhammadan and now shows a partiality
for the English style of dress for outdoor use, the Hindu when indoors still reverts to the one cloth round the waist and
a second over the shoulders, which was probably once the regular garb of his countrymen. For meals the latter is discarded,
and this costume, so strange to English ideas, while partly based on considerations of ceremonial purity, may also be due
to a conservative adherence to the ancient fashion, when sewn clothes were not worn. It is noticeable also that high-caste
Hindus, though they may wear a coat of cloth or tasar silk and cotton trousers, copying the English, still often carry the
<i>dupatta</i> or shoulder-cloth hanging round the neck. This now appears a useless encumbrance, but may be the relic of the old body-cloth
and therefore interesting as a survival in dress, like the buttons on the back of our tail-coats to which the flaps were once
hooked up for riding, or the seams on the backs of gloves, a relic of the time when the glove consisted simply of finger-lengths
sewn together.<a id="d0e12021src" href="#d0e12021" class="noteref">7</a> More recently the <i>dupatta</i> has been made to fulfil the function of a pocket-handkerchief, while the educated are now discarding the <i>dupatta</i> and carry their handkerchiefs in their pockets. The old dress of ceremony for landowners is the <i>angarkha</i>, a long coat reaching to the knees and with flaps folding over the breast and tied with strings. This is worn with pyjamas
and is probably the Muhammadan ceremonial costume as remarked by Buchanan. In its correct form, at, least it has no buttons,
<a id="d0e12036"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12036">470</a>]</span>and recalls the time when a similar state of things prevailed in English dress and the &#8216;trussing of his points&#8217; was a laborious
daily task for every English gentleman. The <i>ghundis</i> or small pieces of cloth made up into a ball, which were the precursors of the button, may still be seen on the cotton coats
of rustics in the rural area.

</p>
<p>The substitution of clothes cut and sewn to fit the body for draped clothes is a matter of regret from an artistic or picturesque
point of view, as the latter have usually a more graceful appearance. This is shown by the difficulty of reproducing modern
clothes in statuary, trousers being usually the despair of the sculptor. But sewn clothes, when once introduced, must always
prevail from considerations of comfort. When a Hindu pulls his <i>dhoti</i> or loin-cloth up his legs and tucks it in round his hips in order to run or play a game he presumably performs the act described
in the Bible as &#8216;girding up his loins.&#8217;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12046">
<h3>4. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The social customs of the Darzis present no features of special interest and resemble those of the lower castes in their locality.
They rank below the cultivating castes, and Br&#257;hmans will not take water from their hands. Though not often employed by the
Hindu villager the Darzi is to Europeans one of the best known of all castes. He is on the whole a capable workman and especially
good at copying from a pattern. His proficiency in this respect attracted notice so long ago as 1689, as shown in an interesting
quotation in the <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i> referring to the tailors of Surat:<a id="d0e12054src" href="#d0e12054" class="noteref">8</a> &#8220;The tailors here fashion clothes for the Europeans, either men or women, according to every mode that prevails, and fit
up the commodes and towering head-dresses for the women with as much skill as if they had been an Indian fashion, or themselves
had been apprenticed at the Royal Exchange. (The commode was a wire structure to raise the cap and hair.)&#8221; Since then the
Darzi has no doubt copied in turn all the changes of English fashions. He is a familiar figure in the veranda of the houses
of Europeans, and his idiosyncrasies have been delightfully described by Eha in <i>Behind the Bungalow</i>. <a id="d0e12065"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12065">471</a>]</span>His needles and pins are stuck into the folds of his turban, and Eha says that he is bandy-legged because of the position
in which he squats on his feet while sewing. In Gujar&#257;t the tailor is often employed in native households. &#8220;Though even in
well-to-do families,&#8221; Mr. Bhimbhai Kirp&#257;ram writes,<a id="d0e12067src" href="#d0e12067" class="noteref">9</a> &#8220;women sew their bodices and young children&#8217;s clothes for everyday wear, every family has its own tailor. As a rule tailors
sew in their own houses, and in the tailor&#8217;s shop may be seen workmen squatting in rows on a palm-leaf mat or on cotton-stuffed
quilts. The wives and sons&#8217; wives of the head of the establishment sit and work in the shop along with the men. Their busy
time is during the marriage season from November to June. A village tailor is paid either in cash or grain and is not infrequently
a member of the village establishment. During the rains, the tailor&#8217;s slack season, he supplements his earnings by tillage,
holding land which Government has continued to him on payment of one-half the ordinary rental. In south Gujar&#257;t, in the absence
of Br&#257;hmans, a Darzi officiates at Bh&#257;wad marriages, and in some Br&#257;hman marriages a Darzi is called with some ceremony to
sew a bodice for the bride. On the other hand, in the P&#257;nch Mahals and Rewa Kantha, besides tailoring Darzis blow trumpets
at marriage and other processions and hold so low a position that even Dhedas object to eat their food.&#8221; It seems clear that
in Gujar&#257;t the Darzi caste is of older standing than in northern India, and it is possible that the art of sewing may have
been acquired through the sea trade which was carried on between the western coast and Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Here the
Darzi has become a village menial, which he is not recorded as being in any other part of India.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12072">
<h3>5. Religion.</h3>
<p>Like the weaver, the Darzi is of a somewhat religious turn of mind, probably on account of his sedentary calling which gives
him plenty of time for reflection. Many of them belong to the N&#257;mdeo sect, originated by a Chh&#299;pa or dyer, N&#257;mdeo S&#257;dhu. N&#257;mdeo
is said to have been a contemporary of Kab&#299;r and to have flourished in the twelfth or thirteenth century. He was a great worshipper
of the <a id="d0e12077"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12077">472</a>]</span>god Vithoba of Pandharpur and is considered by the Mar&#257;thas to be their oldest writer, being the author of many Abhangs, or
sacred hymns.<a id="d0e12079src" href="#d0e12079" class="noteref">10</a> He preached the unity of God, recognising apparently Vithoba or Vishnu as the one deity, and the uselessness of ceremonial.
His followers are mainly Dhobis and Chh&#299;pas, the two principal castes from whom the Darzis have originated.<a id="d0e12084src" href="#d0e12084" class="noteref">11</a> N&#257;mdeo&#8217;s sect was thus apparently a protest on the part of the Chh&#299;pas and Dhobis against their inferior position in the
caste system and the tyranny of the Br&#257;hmans, and resembled the spiritual revolt of the weavers under Kab&#299;r and of the Cham&#257;rs
under Gh&#257;si D&#257;s and Jagj&#299;wan D&#257;s.

</p>
<p>In Ber&#257;r it is stated<a id="d0e12092src" href="#d0e12092" class="noteref">12</a> that &#8220;the Simpi caste has twelve and a half divisions; of these the chief are known as the Jain, Mar&#257;thi and Telugu Simpis.
The Jain Simpis claim the hero Rimin&#257;th as a caste-fellow, while the Mar&#257;thas are often Ling&#257;yats and the Telugu division
generally Vaishnavas.&#8221; Before beginning work in the morning the Darzi bows to his scissors or needle and prays to them for
his livelihood for that day.

</p>
<p>The Darzi&#8217;s occupation, Mr. Crooke remarks, is a poor one and held rather in contempt. The village proverb runs, &#8216;<i lang="und">Darzi ka p&#363;t jab tak j&#299;ta tab tak s&#299;ta</i>,&#8217; &#8216;The tailor&#8217;s boy will do nothing but sew all his life long.&#8217; Another somewhat more complimentary saying is, &#8216;<i lang="und">Tanak si suiya tak tak kare aur l&#257;kh taka ko banj kare</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;The tiny needle goes <i>tuk tuk</i>, and makes merchandise worth a lakh of rupees.&#8217; The Hindustani version of both proverbs is obviously intended to give the
sound of a needle passing through cloth, and it is possible that our word &#8216;tuck&#8217; has the same origin.

<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Dew&#257;r.</b><a id="d0e12117src" href="#d0e12117" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;(Derived from Devi, whom they worship, or from Di&#257;b&#257;r, &#8216;One who lights a lamp,&#8217; because they always practise magic with a
lighted lamp.) A Dravidian caste of beggars and musicians. They numbered about 2500 persons <a id="d0e12120"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12120">473</a>]</span>in 1911 and are residents of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain. The Dew&#257;rs themselves trace their origin from a Binjhia named Gop&#257;l Rai,
who accompanied R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n Sai of Ratanpur on a visit to the Court of Delhi in Akb&#257;r&#8217;s time. Gop&#257;l Rai was a great wrestler,
and while at Delhi he seized and held a <i>mast</i> elephant belonging to the Emperor. When the latter heard of it he ordered a wrestling match to be arranged between Gop&#257;l
Rai and his own champion wrestler. Gop&#257;l Rai defeated and killed his opponent, and Kaly&#257;n Sai ordered him to compose a triumphal
song and sing it in honour of the occasion. He composed his song in favour of Devi Maha Mai, or Devi the Great Mother, and
the composition and recitation of similar songs has ever since been the profession of his descendants the Dew&#257;rs. The caste
is, as is shown by the names of its sections, of mixed origin, and its members are the descendants of Gonds and Kawars reinforced
probably by persons who have been expelled from their own caste and have become Dew&#257;rs. They will still admit persons of any
caste except the very lowest.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12125">
<h3>2. Subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The caste has two principal divisions according to locality, named Raip&#363;ria and Ratanp&#363;ria, Raipur and Ratanpur having been
formerly the two principal towns of Chhatt&#299;sgarh. Within these are several other local subdivisions, <i>e.g.</i> Nav&#257;garhia or those belonging to Naw&#257;garh in Bil&#257;spur, Son&#257;khania from Son&#257;kh&#257;n south of the Mah&#257;nadi, Ch&#257;tarr&#257;jiha from
Ch&#257;ter Raj, in Raipur, and S&#257;rangarhia from S&#257;rangarh State. Some other divisions are either occupational or social; thus
the Baghurra Dew&#257;rs are those who tame tigers and usually live in the direction of Bastar, the Baip&#257;ri Dew&#257;rs are petty traders
in brass or pewter ornaments which they sell to Banj&#257;ra women, and the Loh&#257;r and Jogi Dew&#257;rs may be so called either because
their ancestors belonged to these castes, or because they have adopted the profession of blacksmiths and beggars respectively.
Probably both reasons are partly applicable. These subdivisions are not strictly endogamous, but show a tendency to become
so. The two main subcastes, Raip&#363;ria and Ratanp&#363;ria, are distinguished by the musical instruments which they play on while
begging. That of the Raip&#363;rias is a sort of rude <a id="d0e12133"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12133">474</a>]</span>fiddle called <i>s&#257;rangi</i>, which has a cocoanut shell as a resonator with horsehair strings, and is played with a bow. The Ratanp&#363;rias have an instrument
called <i>dhungru</i>, which consists of a piece of bamboo about three feet long with a hollow gourd as a resonator and catgut strings. In the
latter the resonator is held uppermost and rests against the shoulder of the player, while in the former it is at the lower
end and is placed against his waist. The section names of the Dew&#257;rs are almost all of Dravidian origin. Sonw&#257;nia, Mark&#257;m,
Marai, Dhurwa, Ojha, Net&#257;m, Sal&#257;m, Katl&#257;m and Jagat are the names of well-known Gond septs which are also possessed by the
Dew&#257;rs, and Tel&#257;si, Karsayal, Son-Mungir and others are Kawar septs which they have adopted. They admit that their ancestors
were members of these septs among the Gonds and Kawars. Where the name of the ancestor has a meaning which they understand,
some totemistic observances survive. Thus the members of the Karsayal sept will not kill or eat a deer. The septs are exogamous,
but there is no other restriction on marriage and the union of first cousins is permissible.

<h3>3. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>Adult marriage is usual, and if a husband cannot be found for a girl who has reached maturity she is given to her sister&#8217;s
husband as a second wife, or to any other married person who will take her and give a feast to the caste. In some localities
the boy who is to be married is sent with a few relatives to the girl&#8217;s house. On arrival he places a pot of wine and a nut
before the girl&#8217;s father, who, if he is willing to carry out the marriage, orders the nut to be pounded up. This is always
done by a member of the Sonw&#257;ni sept, a similar respect being paid to this sept among some of the Dravidian tribes. The foreheads
of the betrothed couple are smeared with the nut and with some yellow-coloured rice and they bow low to the elders of the
caste. Usually a bride-price of Rs. 5 or 10 is then paid to the parents of the girl together with two pieces of cloth intended
for their use. A feast follows, which consists merely of the distribution of uncooked food, as the Dew&#257;rs, like some other
low castes, will not take cooked food from each other. Pork and wine are essential ingredients in the feast or the ceremony
cannot be completed. If liquor is not available, water from <a id="d0e12146"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12146">475</a>]</span>the house of a Kal&#257;r (distiller) will do instead, but there is no substitute for pork. This, however, is as a rule easily
supplied as nearly all the Dew&#257;rs keep pigs, which are retailed to the Gonds for their sacrifices. The marriage ceremony is
performed within three or four months at most after the betrothal. Before entering the Mandwa or marriage-shed the bridegroom
must place a jar of liquor in front of his prospective father-in-law. The bridegroom must also place a ring on the little
finger of the bride&#8217;s right hand, while she resists him as much as she can, her hand having previously been smeared with castor
oil in order to make the task more difficult. Before taking the bride away the new husband must pay her father Rs. 20, and
if he cannot do this, and in default of arrangements for remission which are sometimes made, must remain domiciled in his
house for a certain period. As the bride is usually adult there is no necessity for a <i>gauna</i> ceremony, and she leaves for her husband&#8217;s house once for all. Thereafter when she visits the house of her parents she does
so as a stranger, and they will not accept cooked food at her hands nor she at theirs. Neither will her husband&#8217;s parents
accept food from her, and each couple with their unmarried children form an exclusive group in this respect. Such a practice
is found only among the low castes of mixed origin where nobody is certain of his neighbour&#8217;s standing. If a woman has gone
wrong before marriage, most of the ceremonies are omitted. In such a case the bridegroom catches hold of the bride by the
hair and gives her a blow by way of punishment for her sin, and they then walk seven times round the sacred pole, the whole
ceremony taking less than an hour. The bride-price is under these circumstances reduced to Rs. 15. Widow-marriage is permitted,
and while in some localities the new husband need give nothing, in others he must pay as much as Rs. 50 to the relatives of
the deceased husband. If a woman runs away from her husband to another man, the latter must pay to the husband double the
ordinary amount payable for a widow. If he cannot afford this, he must return the woman with Rs. 10 as compensation for the
wrong he has done. The Dew&#257;rs are also reported to have the practice of mortgaging their <a id="d0e12151"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12151">476</a>]</span>wives or making them over temporarily to a creditor in return for a loan. Divorce is allowed for the usual causes and by mutual
consent. The husband must give a feast to the caste, which is looked on as the funeral ceremony of the woman so far as he
is concerned; thereafter she is dead to him and he cannot marry her again on pain of the permanent exclusion of both from
the caste. But a divorced woman can marry any other Dew&#257;r. Polygamy is freely allowed.

<div class="div2" id="d0e12153">
<h3>4. Religion and social practices.</h3>
<p>The Dew&#257;rs especially worship Devi Maha Mai and D&#363;lha Deo. To the former they offer a she-goat and to the latter a he-goat
which must be of a dark colour. They worship their <i>dhungru</i> or musical instrument on the day of Dasahra. They consider the sun and the moon to be brother and sister, and both to be
manifestations of the deity. They bury their dead, but those who are in good circumstances dig up the bones after a year or
two and burn them, taking the ashes to a sacred river. Mourning lasts for seven or ten days according as the deceased is unmarried
or married, and during this time they abjure flesh and oil. Their social rules are peculiar. Though considered impure by the
higher castes, they will not take cooked food from a Br&#257;hman, whom they call a Kumh&#257;ti K&#299;da, or an insect which effects the
metamorphosis of others into his own form, and who will therefore change them into his own caste. Nor will they take cooked
food from members of their own caste, but they accept it from several of the lower castes including Gonds, whose leavings
they will eat. This is probably because they beg from Gonds and attend their weddings. They keep pigs and pork is their favourite
food, but they do not eat beef. They have a tribal council with a headman called Gaontia or Jem&#257;dar, who always belongs either
to the Sonw&#257;ni or Tel&#257;si section. Among offences for which a man is temporarily put out of caste is that of naming his younger
brother&#8217;s wife. He must also abstain from going into her room or touching her clothes. This rule does not apply to an elder
brother&#8217;s wife.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12161">
<h3>5. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The Dew&#257;rs are professional beggars, and play on the musical instruments called <i>dhungru</i> and <i>s&#257;rangi</i> which have already been described. The Ratanp&#363;rias usually celebrate in an exaggerated style the praises of Gop&#257;l Rai, their
<a id="d0e12172"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12172">477</a>]</span>mythical ancestor. One of his exploits was to sever with a single sword-stroke the stalk of a plantain inside which the Emperor
of Delhi had caused a solid bar of iron to be placed. The Raip&#363;rias prefer a song, called Gujr&#299;g&#299;t, about curds and milk.
They also sing various songs relating how a woman is beloved by a R&#257;ja who tries to seduce her, but her chastity is miraculously
saved by some curious combination of circumstances. They exorcise ghosts, train monkeys, bears and tigers for exhibition,
and sell ornaments of base metal. In Raipur the men take about performing monkeys and the women do tattooing, for which they
usually receive payment in the shape of an old or new cloth. A few have settled down to cultivation, but as a rule they are
wanderers, carrying from place to place their scanty outfit of a small tent and mattress, both made of old rags, and a few
vessels. They meet at central villages during the Holi festival. The family is restricted to the parents and unmarried children,
separation usually taking place on marriage.

</span><h2>Dh&#257;kar</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12177">
<h3>1. Origin and subdivisions.</h3>
<p><b>Dh&#257;kar.</b><a id="d0e12183src" href="#d0e12183" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A small caste belonging solely to the Bastar State. In 1911 they numbered 5500 persons in Bastar, and it is noticeable that
there were nearly twice as many women as men. The term Dh&#257;kar connotes a man of illegitimate descent and is applied to the
Kir&#257;rs of the Central Provinces and perhaps to other castes of mixed R&#257;jp&#363;t origin. But in Bastar it is the special designation
of a considerable class of persons who are the descendants of alliances between Br&#257;hman and R&#257;jp&#363;t immigrants and women of
the indigenous tribes. They are divided, like the Halbas, into two groups&#8212;Pur&#257;it or pure, and Sur&#257;it or mixed. The son of
a Br&#257;hman or R&#257;jp&#363;t father by a R&#257;wat (herdsman) or Halba mother is a Pur&#257;it, but one born from a woman of the Muria, Mar&#257;r,
Nai or Kal&#257;r castes is a Sur&#257;it. But these latter can become Pur&#257;its after two or three generations, and the same rule applies
to the son of a Dh&#257;kar father by a Halba or R&#257;wat woman, who also ranks in the first place as a Sur&#257;it. Descendants of a Dh&#257;kar
father by a Muria or other low-caste woman, however, always remain Sur&#257;its. <a id="d0e12186"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12186">478</a>]</span>The Pur&#257;its and Sur&#257;its form endogamous groups, and the latter will accept cooked food from the former. The more respectable
Dh&#257;kars round Jagdalpur are now tending, however, to call themselves R&#257;jp&#363;ts and refuse to admit any one of mixed birth into
their community.

</p>
<p>One legend of their origin is that the first Dh&#257;kar was the offspring of a Br&#257;hman cook of the R&#257;ja of Bastar with a Kosaria
R&#257;wat woman; and though this is discredited by the Dh&#257;kars it is probably a fairly correct version of the facts. An inferior
branch of the caste exists which is known as Chikras&#257;r; it is related of them that their ancestors once went out hunting and
set the forest on fire as a method of driving the game, as they occasionally do still. They came across the roasted body of
a dog in the forest and ate it without knowing what animal it was. In the stomach, however, some cooked rice was found, and
hence it was known as a dog and they were branded as dog-eaters. As a penalty the R&#257;ja imposed on them the duty of thatching
a hut for him at the Dasahra festival, which their descendants still perform. The other Dh&#257;kars refuse to marry or eat with
them, and it is clear from the custom of thatching the R&#257;ja&#8217;s hut that they are a primitive and jungly branch of the caste.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12190">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>If a girl becomes with child by a member of the caste she is made over to him without a marriage, or to the man to whom she
was previously betrothed if he is still willing to take her. Neither is she expelled if the same event occurs with a man of
any higher caste, but if he be of lower caste she is thrown out. Marriages are usually arranged by the parents but an adult
girl may choose her own husband, and she is then wedded to him with abbreviated rites so that her family may avoid the disgrace
of her entering his house like a widow or kept woman. Formerly a Dh&#257;kar might marry his granddaughter, but this is no longer
done. When the signs of puberty first appear in a girl she is secluded and must not see or be seen by any man. They think
that the souls of dead ancestors are reborn in children, and if a child refuses to suck they ask which of their ancestors
he is and what he wants, or they offer it some present such as a silver bangle, and if the child then takes to the breast
they give away the bangle to a Br&#257;hman. The sixth day after a child is born <a id="d0e12195"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12195">479</a>]</span>the paternal aunt prepares lamp-black from a lamp fed with melted butter and rubs it on the child&#8217;s eyes and receives a small
present.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12197">
<h3>3. Funeral rites.</h3>
<p>The period of mourning or impurity after a death must terminate with a feast to the caste-men, and it continues until this
is given. Consequently the other caste-men subscribe for a poor member, so that he may give the feast and resume his ordinary
avocations. On this occasion one of the guests puts a small fish in a leaf-cup full of water, which no doubt represents the
spirit of the deceased, and all the mourners touch this cup and are freed from their impurity. A Br&#257;hman is also invited,
who lights a lamp fed with melted butter and then asks for a cow or some other valuable present as a recompense for his service
of blowing out the lamp. Until this is done the Dh&#257;kars think that the soul of the departed is tortured by the flame of the
lamp. If the Br&#257;hman is pleased, he pours some curds over the lamp and this acts as a cooling balm to the soul. When a member
of the family dies the mourners shave the whole head with beard and moustache.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12202">
<h3>4. Occupation and social status.</h3>
<p>The Dh&#257;kars are mainly engaged in cultivation as farmservants and labourers. Like the Halbas, they consider it a sin to heat
or forge iron, looking upon the metal as sacred. They eat the flesh of clean animals, but abstain from both pigs and chickens,
and some also do not eat the peacock. A man as well as a woman is permanently expelled for adultery with a person of lower
caste, the idea of this rule being no doubt to prevent degradation in the status of the caste from the admission of the offspring
of such unions. If one Dh&#257;kar beats another with a shoe, both are temporarily put out of caste. But if a man seduces a caste-man&#8217;s
wife and is beaten with a shoe by the husband, he is permanently expelled, while the husband is readmitted after a feast.
On being received back into caste intercourse an offender is purified by drinking water in which the image of a local god
has been dipped or the R&#257;ja of Bastar has placed his toe. Like other low castes of mixed origin, they are very particular
about each other&#8217;s status and will only accept cooked food from families who are well known to them. At caste feasts each
family or group of families cooks for <a id="d0e12207"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12207">480</a>]</span>itself, and in some cases parents refuse to eat with the family into which their daughter has married and hence cannot do
so with the girl herself.

</span><h2>Dhangar</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12212">
<h3>1. Traditions and structure of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Dhangar.</b><a id="d0e12218src" href="#d0e12218" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;The Mar&#257;tha caste of shepherds and blanket-weavers, numbering 96,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r. They reside
principally in the N&#257;gpur, Wardha, Ch&#257;nda and Nim&#257;r Districts of the Central Provinces and in all Districts of Ber&#257;r. The
Dhangars are a very numerous caste in Bombay and Hyder&#257;b&#257;d. The name is derived either from the Sanskrit <i>dhenu</i>, a cow, or more probably from <i>dhan</i>,<a id="d0e12227src" href="#d0e12227" class="noteref">2</a> wealth, a term which is commonly applied to flocks of sheep and goats. It is said that the first sheep and goats came out
of an ant-hill and scattering over the fields began to damage the crops of the cultivators. They, being helpless, prayed to
Mah&#257;deo to rescue them from this pest and he thereupon created the first Dhangar to tend the flocks. The Dhangars consequently
revere an ant-hill, and never remove one from their fields, while they worship it on the Diw&#257;li day with offerings of rice,
flowers and part of the ear of a goat. When tending and driving sheep and goats they ejaculate &#8216;Har, Har,&#8217; which is a name
of Mah&#257;deo used by devotees in worshipping him. The Dhangars furnished a valuable contingent to Sivaji&#8217;s guerilla soldiery,
and the ruling family of Indore State belong to this caste. It is divided into the following subcastes: Var&#257;di or Bar&#257;de,
belonging to Ber&#257;r; K&#257;nore or K&#257;nade, of Kanara; Jh&#257;de, or those belonging to the Bhand&#257;ra, B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t and Chhindw&#257;ra Districts,
called the Jh&#257;di or hill country; L&#257;dse, found in Hyder&#257;b&#257;d; G&#257;dri, from <i>g&#257;dar</i>, a sheep, a division probably consisting of northerners, as the name for the cognate caste of shepherds in Hindust&#257;n is Gadaria;
Telange, belonging to the Telugu country; Mar&#257;the, of the Mar&#257;tha country; M&#257;hurai from M&#257;hur in Hyder&#257;b&#257;d, and one or two
others. Eleven subcastes in all are reported. For the purposes of marriage a number of exogamous groups or septs exist which
may be classified according to their nomenclature as titular and totemistic, many having also the <a id="d0e12233"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12233">481</a>]</span>names of other castes. Examples of sept names are: Pow&#257;r, a R&#257;jp&#363;t sept; Dokra, an old man; M&#257;rte, a murderer or slayer; Sarodi,
the name of a caste of mendicants; Mh&#257;li, a barber; Kaode, a crow; Chambh&#257;de, a Cham&#257;r; G&#363;jde, a G&#363;jar; Ju&#257;de, a gambler;
Lamchote, long-haired; Bodke, bald-headed; Khat&#299;k, a butcher; Ch&#257;ndekar, from Ch&#257;nda; Dambh&#257;de, one having pimples on the
body; Halle, a he-buffalo; Moya, a grass, and others. The sept names show that the caste is a functional one of very mixed
composition, partly recruited from members of other castes who have taken to sheep-tending and generally from the non-Aryan
tribes.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12235">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>A man must not marry within his own sept or that of his mother, nor may he marry a first cousin. He may wed a younger sister
of his wife during her lifetime, and the practice of marrying a girl and boy into the same family, called Anta S&#257;nta or exchange,
is permitted. Occasionally the husband does service for his wife in his father-in-law&#8217;s house. In Wardha the Dhangars measure
the heights of a prospective bride and bridegroom with a piece of string and consider it a suitable match if the husband is
taller than the wife, whether he be older or not. Marriages may be infant or adult, and polygamy is permitted, no stigma attaching
to the taking of a second wife. Weddings may be celebrated in the rains up to the month of Kunw&#257;r (September), this provision
probably arising from the fact that many Dhangars wander about the country during the open season, and are only at home during
the rainy months. Perhaps for the same reason the wedding may, if the officiating priest so directs, be held at the house
of a Br&#257;hman. This happens only when the Br&#257;hman has sown an offering of rice, called G&#257;g, in the name of the goddess R&#257;na
Devi, the favourite deity of the Dhangars. On his way to the bride&#8217;s house the bridegroom must be covered with a black blanket.
Nowadays the wedding is sometimes held at the bridegroom&#8217;s house and the bride comes for it. The caste say that this is done
because there are not infrequently among the members of the bridegroom&#8217;s family widows who have remarried or women who have
been kept by men of higher castes or been guilty of adultery. The bride&#8217;s female <a id="d0e12240"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12240">482</a>]</span>relatives refuse to wash the feet of these women and this provokes quarrels. To meet such cases the new rule has been introduced.
At the wedding the priest sits on the roof of the house facing the west, and the bride and bridegroom stand below with a curtain
between them. As the sun is half set he claps his hands and the bridegroom takes the clasped hands of the bride within his
own, the curtain being withdrawn. The bridegroom ties round the bride&#8217;s neck a yellow thread of seven strands, and when this
is done she is married. Next morning a black bead necklace is substituted for the thread. The expenses of the bridegroom&#8217;s
party are about Rs. 50, and of the bride&#8217;s about Rs. 30. The remaining procedure follows the customary usage of the Mar&#257;tha
Districts. Widows are permitted to marry again, but must not take a second husband from the sept to which the first belonged.
A considerable price is paid for a widow, and it is often more expensive to marry one than a girl. A Br&#257;hman and the m&#257;lguz&#257;r
(village proprietor) should be present at the ceremony. If a bachelor marries a widow he must first go through the ceremony
with a silver ring, and if the ring is subsequently lost or broken, its funeral rites must be performed. Divorce is allowed
in the presence of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> at the instance of either party for sufficient reason, as the misconduct or bad temper of the wife or the impotency of the
husband.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12245">
<h3>3. Religion.</h3>
<p>Mah&#257;deo is the special deity of the Dhangars, and they also observe the ordinary Hindu festivals. At Diw&#257;li they worship their
goats by dyeing their horns and touching their feet. One Bahr&#257;m of N&#257;changaon near Pulgaon is the tutelary deity of the Wardha
Dhangars and the protector of their flocks. On the last day of the month of M&#257;gh they perform a special ceremony called the
Deo P&#363;ja. A Dh&#299;mar acts as priest to the caste on this occasion and fashions some figures of idols out of rice to which vermilion
and flowers are offered. He then distributes the grains of rice to the Dhangars who are present, pronouncing a benediction.
The Dh&#299;mar receives his food and a present, and it is essential that the act of worship should be performed by one of this
caste. In their houses they have Kul-Devi <a id="d0e12250"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12250">483</a>]</span>and Khandoba the Mar&#257;tha hero, who are the family deities. But in large families they are kept only in the house of the eldest
brother. Kul-Devi or the goddess of the family is worshipped at weddings, and a goat is offered to her in the month of Chait
(March). The head is buried beneath her shrine inside the house and the body is consumed by members of the family only. Khandoba
is worshipped on Sundays and they identify him with the sun. Vithoba, a form of Vishnu, is revered on Wednesdays, and B&#257;l&#257;ji,
the younger brother of R&#257;ma, on Fridays. Many families also make a representation of some deceased bachelor relative, which
they call Munjia, and of some married woman who is known as Mairni or S&#257;sin, and worship them daily.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12252">
<h3>4. Birth, death and social status.</h3>
<p>The Dhangars burn their dead unless they are too poor to purchase wood for fuel, in which case burial is resorted to. Unmarried
children and persons dying from smallpox, leprosy, cholera and snake-bite are also buried. At the pyre the widow breaks her
bangles and throws her glass beads on to her husband&#8217;s body. On returning from the burning <i>gh&#257;t</i> the funeral party drink liquor. Some g&#257;nja, tobacco and anything else which the deceased may have been fond of during his
life are left near the grave on the first day. Mourning is observed during ten days on the death of an adult and for three
days for a child. Children are usually named on the twelfth day after birth, the well-to-do employing a Br&#257;hman for the purpose.
On this day the child must not see a lamp, as it is feared that if he should do so he will afterwards have a squint. Only
one name is given as a rule, but subsequently when the child comes to be married, if the Br&#257;hman finds that its name does
not make the marriage auspicious, he substitutes another and the child is afterwards known by this new name. The caste employ
Br&#257;hmans for ceremonies at birth and marriage. They eat flesh including fowls and wild pig, and drink liquor, but abstain
from other unclean food. They will take food from a Kunbi, Ph&#363;lm&#257;li or a Sun&#257;r, and water from any of the good cultivating
castes. A Kunbi will take water from them. The women of the caste wear bracelets of lead or brass on the right wrist and glass
bangles on the left. Permanent or temporary excommunication from caste <a id="d0e12260"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12260">484</a>]</span>is imposed for the usual offences, and among those visited with the minor penalty are selling shoes, touching the carcase
of a dog or cat, and killing a cow or buffalo, or allowing one to die with a rope round its neck. No food is cooked for five
weeks in a house in which a cat has died. The social standing of the caste is low.

<h3>5. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The traditional occupation of the Dhangars is to tend sheep and goats, and they also sell goats&#8217; milk, make blankets from
the wool of sheep, and sometimes breed and sell stock for slaughter. They generally live near tracts of waste land where grazing
is available. Sheep are kept in open and goats in roofed folds. Like English shepherds they carry sticks or staffs and have
dogs to assist in driving the flocks, and they sometimes hunt hares with their dogs. Their dress consists frequently only
of a loin-cloth and a blanket, and having to bear exposure to all weathers, they are naturally strong and hardy. In appearance
they are dark and of medium size. They eat three times a day and bathe in the evening on returning from work, though their
ablutions are sometimes omitted in the cold weather.

</span><h2>Dh&#257;nuk</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12270">
<h3>1. Original and classical records.</h3>
<p><b>Dh&#257;nuk.</b>&#8212;A low caste of agriculturists found principally in the Narsinghpur District, which contained three-fourths of the total of
nearly 7000 persons returned in 1911. The headquarters of the caste are in the United Provinces, which contains more than
a lakh of Dh&#257;nuks. The name is derived from the Sanskrit <i>dhanuska</i>, an archer, and the caste is an ancient one, its origin as given in the Padma Pur&#257;na, quoted by Sir Henry Elliot, being from
a Cham&#257;r father and a Chand&#257;l or sweeper mother. Another pedigree makes the mother a Cham&#257;r and the father an outcaste Ah&#299;r.
Such statements, Sir H. Risley remarks in commenting on this genealogy,<a id="d0e12280src" href="#d0e12280" class="noteref">1</a> serve to indicate in a general way the social rank held by the Dh&#257;nuks at the time when it was first thought necessary to
enrol them among the mixed castes. Dr. Buchanan<a id="d0e12285src" href="#d0e12285" class="noteref">2</a> says that the Dh&#257;nuks were in former times the militia of the country. He states that all the Dh&#257;nuks <a id="d0e12293"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12293">485</a>]</span>were at one time probably slaves and many were recruited to fill up the military ranks&#8212;a method of security which had long
been prevalent in Asia, the armies of the Parthians having been composed entirely of slaves. A great many Dh&#257;nuks, at the
time when Buchanan wrote, were still slaves, but some annually procured their liberty by the inability of their masters to
maintain them and their unwillingness to sell their fellow-creatures. It may be concluded, therefore, that the Dh&#257;nuks were
a body of servile soldiery, recruited as was often the case from the subject Dravidian tribes; following the all-powerful
tendency of Hindu society they became a caste, and owing to the comparatively respectable nature of their occupation obtained
a rise in social position from the outcaste status of the subject Dravidians to the somewhat higher group of castes who were
not unclean but from whom a Br&#257;hman would not accept water. They did not advance so far as the Khandaits, another caste formed
from military service, who were also, Sir H. Risley shows, originally recruited from a subject tribe, probably because the
position of the Dh&#257;nuks was always more subordinate and no appreciable number of them came to be officers or leaders. The
very debased origin of the caste already mentioned as given in the Padma Pur&#257;na may be supposed as in other cases to be an
attempt on the part of the priestly chronicler to repress what he considered to be unfounded claims to a rise in rank. But
the Dh&#257;nuks, not less than the other soldier castes, have advanced a pretension to be Kshatriyas, those of Narsinghpur sometimes
calling themselves Dh&#257;nkarai R&#257;jp&#363;ts, though this claim is of course in their case a pure absurdity. It is not necessary to
suppose that the Dh&#257;nuks of the Central Provinces are the lineal descendants of the caste whose genealogy is given in the
Pur&#257;nas; they may be a much more recent offshoot from a main caste, formed in a precisely similar manner from military service.<a id="d0e12295src" href="#d0e12295" class="noteref">3</a> Mr. Crooke<a id="d0e12298src" href="#d0e12298" class="noteref">4</a> surmises that they belonged to the large impure caste of Basors or basket-makers, who took to bow-making and thence to archery;
and some connection is traceable between the <a id="d0e12303"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12303">486</a>]</span>Dh&#257;nuks and Basors in Narsinghpur. Such a separation must probably have occurred in comparatively recent times, inasmuch as
some recollection of it still remains. The fact that Lodhis are the only caste besides Br&#257;hmans from whom the Dh&#257;nuks of Narsinghpur
will take food cooked without water may indicate that they formed the militia of Lodhi chieftains in the Nerbudda valley,
a hypothesis which is highly probable on general grounds.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12305">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>In the Central Provinces the Dh&#257;nuks have no subcastes.<a id="d0e12310src" href="#d0e12310" class="noteref">5</a> The names of their <i>gotras</i> or family groups, though they themselves cannot explain them, are apparently territorial: as M&#257;ragaiy&#257;n from M&#257;ragaon, Benaikaw&#257;r
from Benaika village, Pangarya from Pan&#257;gar, Binjharia from Bindhya or Vindhya, Barodhaya from Barodha village, and so on.
Marriages within the same <i>gotra</i> and between first cousins are prohibited, and child-marriage is usual. The father of the boy always takes the initiative
in arranging a match, and if a man wants to find a husband for his daughter he must ask the assistance of his relatives to
obtain a proposal, as it would be derogatory to move in the matter himself. The contract for marriages is made at the boy&#8217;s
house and is not inviolable. Before the departure of the bridegroom for the bride&#8217;s village, he stands at the entrance of
the marriage-shed, and his mother comes up and places her breast to his mouth and throws rice balls and ashes over him. The
former action signifies the termination of his boyhood, while the latter is meant to protect him on his important journey.
The bridegroom in walking away treads on a saucer in which a little rice is placed. Widow-marriage and divorce are permitted.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12319">
<h3>3. Social rank and customs.</h3>
<p>A few members of the caste are tenants and the bulk of them farmservants and field-labourers. They also act as village watchmen.
The Dh&#257;nuks eat flesh and fish, but not fowls, beef or pork, and they abstain from liquor. They will take food cooked without
water from a Br&#257;hman and a Lodhi, but not from a R&#257;jp&#363;t; but in Nim&#257;r the status of the caste is distinctly lower, and they
eat pig&#8217;s flesh and the leavings of Br&#257;hmans and R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The mixed nature of <a id="d0e12324"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12324">487</a>]</span>the caste is shown by the fact that they will receive into the community illegitimate children born of a Dh&#257;nuk father and
a woman of a higher caste such as Lodhi or Kurmi. They rank as already indicated just above the impure castes.

<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Dhanw&#257;r, Dhanuh&#257;r.</b><a id="d0e12409src" href="#d0e12409" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A primitive tribe living in the wild hilly country of the Bil&#257;spur zam&#299;nd&#257;ri estates, adjoining Chota N&#257;gpur. They numbered
only 19,000 persons in 1911. The name Dhanuh&#257;r means a bowman, and the bulk of the tribe have until recently been accustomed
to obtain their livelihood by hunting with bow and arrows. The name is thus merely a functional term and is analogous to those
of Dh&#257;ngar, or labourer, and Kis&#257;n, or cultivator, which are applied to the Oraons, and perhaps Halba or farmservant, by which
another tribe is known. The Dhanw&#257;rs are almost certainly not connected with the Dh&#257;nuks of northern India, though the names
have the same meaning. They are probably an offshoot of either the Gond or the Kawar tribe or a mixture of both. Their own
legend of their origin is nearly the same as that of the Gonds, while the bulk of their sept or family names are identical
with those of the Kawars. Like the Kawars, the Dhanw&#257;rs have no language of their own and speak a corrupt form of Chhatt&#299;sgarhi
Hindi. Mr. Jeor&#257;khan L&#257;l writes of them:&#8212;&#8220;The word Dhanuh&#257;r is a corrupt form of Dhanusdh&#257;r or a holder of a bow. The bow
consists of a cleft piece of bamboo <a id="d0e12412"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12412">489</a>]</span>and the arrow is made of wood of the <i>dh&#257;man</i> tree.<a id="d0e12417src" href="#d0e12417" class="noteref">2</a> The pointed end is furnished with a piece or a nail of iron called <i>phani</i>, while to the other end are attached feathers of the vulture or peacock with a string of tasar silk. Dhanuh&#257;r boys learn
the use of the bow at five years of age, and kill birds with it when they are seven or eight years old. At their marriage
ceremony the bridegroom carries an arrow with him in place of a dagger as among the Hindus, and each household has a bow which
is worshipped at every festival.&#8221; According to their own legend the ancestors of the Dhanuh&#257;rs were two babies whom a tigress
unearthed from the ground when scratching a hole in her den, and brought up with her own young. They were named N&#257;ga Lodha
and N&#257;gi Lodhi, <i>N&#257;ga</i> meaning naked and <i>Lodha</i> being the Chhatt&#299;sgarhi word for a wild dog. Growing up they lived for some time as brother and sister, until the deity enjoined
them to marry. But they had no children until N&#257;ga Lodha, in obedience to the god&#8217;s instructions, gave his wife the fruit
of eleven trees to eat. From these she had eleven sons at a birth, and as she observed a fortnight&#8217;s impurity for each of
them the total period was five and a half months. In memory of this, Dhanuh&#257;r women still remain impure for five months after
delivery, and do not worship the gods for that period. Afterwards the couple had a twelfth son, who was born with a bow and
arrows in his hand, and is now the ancestral hero of the tribe, being named Karankot. One day in the forest when Karankot
was not with them, the eleven brothers came upon a wooden palisade, inside which were many deer and antelope tended by twelve
Gaoli (herdsmen) brothers with their twelve sisters. The Lodha brothers attacked the place, but were taken prisoners by the
Gaolis and forced to remove dung and other refuse from the enclosure. After a time Karankot went in search of his brothers
and, coming to the place, defeated the Gaolis and rescued them and carried off the twelve sisters. The twelve brothers subsequently
married the twelve Gaoli girls, Karankot himself being wedded to the youngest and most beautiful, whose name was Masw&#257;si.
From each couple is supposed to be descended one of the tribes who live in <a id="d0e12430"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12430">490</a>]</span>this country, as the Binjhw&#257;r, Bhumia, Korwa, M&#257;jhi, Kol, Kawar and others, the Dhanuh&#257;rs themselves being the progeny of
Karankot and Masw&#257;si. The bones of the animals killed by Karankot were thrown into ditches dug round the village and form
the pits of <i>chhui mithi</i> or white clay now existing in this tract.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12435">
<h3>2. Exogamous septs.</h3>
<p>The Dhanuh&#257;rs, being a small tribe, have no endogamous divisions, but are divided into a number of totemistic exogamous septs.
Many of the septs are called after plants or animals, and members of the sept refrain from killing or destroying the animal
or plant after which it is named. The names of the septs are generally Chhatt&#299;sgarhi words, though a few are Gondi. Out of
fifty names returned twenty are also found in the Kawar tribe and four among the Gonds. This makes it probable that the Dhanuh&#257;rs
are mainly an offshoot from the Kawars with an admixture of Gonds and other tribes. A peculiarity worth noticing is that one
or two of the septs have been split up into a number of others. The best instance of this is the Sonw&#257;ni sept, which is found
among several castes and tribes in Chhatt&#299;sgarh; its name is perhaps derived from <i>Sona p&#257;ni</i> (Gold water), and its members have the function of readmitting those temporarily expelled from social intercourse by pouring
on them a little water into which a piece of gold has been dipped. Among the Dhanuh&#257;rs the Sonw&#257;ni sept has become divided
into the Son-Sonw&#257;ni, who pour the gold water over the penitent; the Rakat Sonw&#257;ni, who give him to drink a little of the
blood of the sacrificial fowl; the Hardi Sonw&#257;ni, who give turmeric water to the mourners when they come back from a funeral;
the K&#257;ri Sonw&#257;ni, who assist at this ceremony; and one or two others. The totem of the K&#257;ri Sonw&#257;ni sept is a black cow, and
when such an animal dies in the village members of the sept throw away their earthen pots. All these are now separate exogamous
septs. The Desw&#257;rs are another sept which has been divided in the same manner. They are, perhaps, a more recent accession
to the tribe, and are looked down on by the others because they will eat the flesh of bison. The other Dhanw&#257;rs refuse to
do this because they say that when S&#299;ta, R&#257;ma&#8217;s wife, was exiled in the jungles, she could not find a cow to worship and so
revered a bison <a id="d0e12443"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12443">491</a>]</span>in its stead. And they say that the animal&#8217;s feet are grey because of the turmeric water which S&#299;ta poured on them, and that
the depression on its forehead is the mark of her hand when she placed a <i>t&#299;ka</i> or sign there with coloured rice. The Desw&#257;rs are also called Dui Du&#257;ria or &#8216;Those having two doors,&#8217; because they have a
back door to their huts which is used only by women during their monthly period of impurity and kept shut at all other times.
One of the septs is named Manakhia, which means &#8216;man-eater,&#8217; and it is possible that its members formerly offered human sacrifices.
Similarly, the Rakat-bund or &#8216;Drop of blood Desw&#257;rs&#8217; may be so called because they shed human blood. A member of the Tel&#257;si
or &#8216;Oil&#8217; sept, when he has killed a deer, will cut off the head and bring it home; placing it in his courtyard, he suspends
a burning lamp over the head and places grains of rice on the forehead of the deer; and he then considers that he is revering
the oil in the lamp. Members of the S&#363;rajgoti or sun sept are said to have stood as representatives of the sun in the rite
of the purification of an offender.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12448">
<h3>3. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Marriage within the sept is prohibited, and usually also between first cousins. Girls are commonly married a year or two after
they arrive at maturity. The father of the boy looks out for a suitable girl for his son and sends a friend to make the proposal.
If this is accepted a feast is given, and is known as Ph&#363;l Phulw&#257;ri or &#8216;The bursting of the flower.&#8217; The betrothal itself
is called Phald&#257;n or &#8216;The gift of the fruit&#8217;; on this occasion the contract is ratified and the usual presents are exchanged.
Yet a third ceremony, prior to the marriage, is that of the Barokhi or inspection, when the bride and bridegroom are taken
to see each other. On this occasion they exchange copper rings, placing them on each other&#8217;s finger, and the boy offers vermilion
to the earth, and then rubs it on the bride&#8217;s forehead. When the girl is mature the date of the wedding is fixed, a small
bride-price of six rupees and a piece of cloth being usually paid. If the first signs of puberty appear in the girl during
the bright fortnight of the month, the marriage is held during the dark fortnight and vice versa. The marriage-shed is built
in the form of a rectangle and must consist of either seven or nine posts in three lines. The bridegroom&#8217;s party <a id="d0e12453"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12453">492</a>]</span>comprises from twenty to forty persons of both sexes. When they arrive at the bride&#8217;s village her father comes out to meet
them and gives them leaf-pipes to smoke. He escorts them inside the village where a lodging has been prepared for them. The
ceremony is based on that of the local Hindus with numerous petty variations in points of detail. In the actual ceremony the
bride and bridegroom are first supported on the knees of two relatives. A sheet is held between them and each throws seven
handfuls of parched rice over the other. They are then made to stand side by side; a knot is made of their cloths containing
a piece of turmeric, and the bride&#8217;s left hand is laid over the bridegroom&#8217;s right one, and on it a <i>sendhaura</i> or wooden box for vermilion is placed. The bride&#8217;s mother moves seven times round the pair holding a lighted lamp, at which
she warms her hand and then touches the marriage-crowns of the bride and bridegroom seven times in succession. And finally
the couple walk seven times round the marriage-post, the bridegroom following the bride. The marriage is held during the day,
and not, as is usual, at night or in the early morning. Afterwards, the pair are seated in the marriage-shed, the bridegroom&#8217;s
leg being placed over that of the bride, with their feet in a brass dish. The bride&#8217;s mother then washes their great toes
with milk and the rest of their feet with water. The bridegroom applies vermilion seven times to the marriage-post and to
his wife&#8217;s forehead at the parting of her hair. The couple are fed with rice and pulses one after the other out of the same
leaf-plates, and the parties have a feast. Next morning, before their departure, the father of the bride asks the bridegroom
to do his best to put up with his daughter, who is thievish, gluttonous and so slovenly that she lets her food drop on to
the floor; but if he finds he cannot endure her, to send her home. In the same manner the father of the boy apologises for
his son, saying that he cares only for mischief and pleasure. The party then returns to the bridegroom&#8217;s house.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12458">
<h3>4. Festivities of the women of the bridegroom&#8217;s party.</h3>
<p>During the absence of the wedding party the women of the bridegroom&#8217;s house with others in the village sing songs at night
in the marriage-shed constructed at his house. These are known as Dindwa, a term applied to a <a id="d0e12463"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12463">493</a>]</span>man who has no wife, whether widower or bachelor. As they sing, the women dance in two lines with their arms interlaced, clapping
their hands as they move backwards and forwards. The songs are of a lewd character, treating of intrigues in love mingled
with abuse of their relatives and of other men who may be watching the proceedings by stealth. No offence is taken on such
occasions, whatever may be said. In Upper India, Mr. Jeor&#257;kh&#257;n L&#257;l states such songs are sung at the time of the marriage
and are called <i>Naktoureki louk</i> or the ceremony of the useless or shameless ones, because women, however shy and modest, become at this time as bold and
shameless as men are at the Holi festival. The following are a few lines from one of these songs:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>The wheat-cake is below and the urad-cake is above. Do you see my brother&#8217;s brother-in-law watching the dance in the narrow
lane.<a id="d0e12471src" href="#d0e12471" class="noteref">3</a>


</p>
<p>A sweetmeat is placed on the wheat-cake; a handsome young black-guard has climbed on to the top of the wall to see the dance.


</p>
<p>When a woman sees a man from afar he looks beautiful and attractive: but when he comes near she sees that he is not worth
the trouble.


</p>
<p>I went to the market and came back with my salt. Oh, I looked more at you than at my husband who is wedded to me.</p>
</div><p>



</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12484">
<h3>5. Conclusion of the marriage.</h3>
<p>Several of the ceremonies are repeated at the bridegroom&#8217;s house after the return of the wedding party. On the day following
them the couple are taken to a tank walking under a canopy held up by their friends. Here they throw away their marriage-crowns,
and play at hiding a vessel under the water. When they return to the house a goat is sacrificed to Dulha Deo and the bride
cooks food in her new house for the first time, her husband helping her, and their relatives and friends in the village are
invited to partake of it. After this the conjugal chamber is prepared by the women of the household, and the bride is taken
to it and told to consider her husband&#8217;s house as her own. The couple are then left together and the marriage is consummated.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12489">
<h3>6. Widow-marriage and divorce.</h3>
<p>The remarriage of widows is permitted but it is not considered as a real marriage, according to the <a id="d0e12494"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12494">494</a>]</span>saying: &#8220;A woman cannot be anointed twice with the marriage oil, as a wooden cooking-vessel cannot be put twice on the fire.&#8221;
A widow married again is called a <i lang="und">Churiy&#257;hi Dauki</i> or &#8216;Wife made by bangles,&#8217; as the ceremony may be completed by putting bangles on her wrists. When a woman is going to marry
again she leaves her late husband&#8217;s house and goes and lives with her own people or in a house by herself. The second husband
makes his proposal to her through some other women. If accepted he comes with a party of his male friends, taking with him
a new cloth and some bangles. They are received by the widow&#8217;s guardian, and they sit in her house smoking and chewing tobacco
while some woman friend retires with her and invests her with the new cloth and bangles. She comes out and the new husband
and wife bow to all the Dhanw&#257;rs, who are subsequently regaled with liquor and goats&#8217; flesh, and the marriage is completed.
Polygamy is permitted but is not common. A husband may divorce his wife for failing to bear him issue, for being ugly, thievish,
shrewish or a witch, or for an intrigue with another man. If a married woman commits adultery with another man of the tribe
they are pardoned with the exaction of one feast. If her paramour is a Gond, R&#257;wat, Binjhw&#257;r or Kawar, he is allowed to become
a Dhanw&#257;r and marry her on giving several feasts, the exact number being fixed by the village Baiga or priest in a <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee. With these exceptions a married woman having an intrigue with a man of another caste is finally expelled. A
wife who desires to divorce her husband without his agreement is also turned out of the caste like a common woman.

<h3>7. Childbirth.</h3>
<p>After the birth of a child the mother receives no food for the first and second, and fourth and fifth days, while on the third
she is given only a warm decoction to drink. On the sixth day the men of the house are shaved and their impurity ceases. But
the mother cooks no food for two months after bearing a female child and for three months if it is a male. The period has
thus been somewhat reduced from the traditional one of five and a half months,<a id="d0e12507src" href="#d0e12507" class="noteref">4</a> but it must still be highly inconvenient. At the expiration of the time of impurity the <a id="d0e12510"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12510">495</a>]</span>earthen pots are changed and the mother prepares a meal for the whole household. During her monthly period of impurity a woman
cooks no food for six days. On the seventh day she bathes and cleans her hair with clay, and is then again permitted to touch
the drinking water and cook food.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12512">
<h3>8. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
<p>The tribe bury the dead. The corpse is wrapped in an old cloth and carried to the grave on a cot turned upside down. On arrival
there it is washed with turmeric and water and wrapped in a new cloth. The bearers carry the corpse seven times round the
open grave, saying, &#8216;This is your last marriage,&#8217; that is, with the earth. The male relatives and friends fill in the grave
with earth, working with their hands only and keep their backs turned to the grave so as to avoid seeing the corpse. It is
said that each person should throw only five handfuls. Other people then come up and fill in the grave, trampling down the
surface as much as possible. For three days after a death the bereaved family do not cook for themselves but are supplied
with food by their friends. These, however, do not give them any salt as it is thought that the craving for salt will divert
their minds from dwelling on their loss. The tribe do not perform the <i>shr&#257;ddh</i> ceremony, but in the month of Kunw&#257;r, on the day corresponding to that on which his father died, a man feeds the caste-fellows
in memory of him. And at this period he offers libations to his ancestors, pouring a double handful of water on the ground
for each one that he can remember and then one for all the others. While doing this he stands facing the east and does not
turn to three different directions as the Hindu custom is. The spirit of a man who has been killed by a tiger becomes Baghia
Mas&#257;n or the tiger imp, and that of a woman who dies in childbirth becomes a Churel. Both are very troublesome to the living.

<div class="div2" id="d0e12520">
<h3>9. Religion.</h3>
<p>The principal deities of the Dhanw&#257;rs are Th&#257;kur Deo, the god of agriculture, and D&#363;lha Deo, the deity of the family and hearth.
Twice a year the village Baiga or medicine-man, who is usually a Gond, offers a cocoanut to Th&#257;kur Deo. He first consecrates
it to the god by placing it in contact with water and the small heap of rice which <a id="d0e12525"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12525">496</a>]</span>lies in front of his shrine, and then splits it asunder on a stone, saying, &#8216;<i lang="und">Jai Th&#257;kur Deo</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;Victory to Th&#257;kur Deo.&#8217; When any serious calamity befalls the tribe a goat is offered to the deity. It must also be
first consecrated to him by eating his rice; its body is then washed in water and some of the sacred <i>d&#363;b</i><a id="d0e12532src" href="#d0e12532" class="noteref">5</a> grass is placed on it, and the Baiga severs the head from the body with an axe. D&#363;lha Deo is the god of the family and the
marriage-bed, and when a Dhanw&#257;r is married or his first son is born, a goat is offered to the deity. Another interesting
deity is Maiya Andhiy&#257;ri, or the goddess of the dark fortnight of the month. She is worshipped in the house conjointly by
husband and wife on any Tuesday in the dark fortnight of M&#257;gh (January-February), all the relatives of the family being invited.
On the day of worship the husband and wife observe a fast, and all the water which is required for use in the house during
the day and night must be brought into it in the early morning. A circular pit is dug inside the house, about three feet deep
and as many wide. A she-goat which has borne no young is sacrificed to the goddess in the house in the same manner as in the
sacrifice to Th&#257;kur Deo. The goat is skinned and cut up, the skin, bones and other refuse being thrown into the hole. The
flesh is cooked and eaten with rice and pulse in the evening, all the family and relatives, men and women, eating together
at the same time. After the meal, all the remaining food and the water including that used for cooking, and the new earthen
pots used to carry water on that day are thrown into the pit. The mouth of the pit is then covered with wooden boards and
plastered over with mud with great care to prevent a child falling into it; as it is held that nothing which has once gone
into the pit may be taken out, even if it were a human being. It is said that once in the old days a man who happened to fall
into the pit was buried alive, its mouth being covered over with planks of wood; and he was found alive when the pit was reopened
next year. This is an instance of the sacrificial meal, common to many primitive peoples, at which the sacred animal was consumed
by the worshippers, skin, bones and <a id="d0e12536"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12536">497</a>]</span>all. But now that such a course has become repugnant to their more civilised digestions, the refuse is considered sacred and
disposed of in some such manner as that described. The goddess is also known as R&#257;t Devi or the goddess of the night; or R&#257;t
Mai, the night mother. The goddess Masw&#257;si was the mythical ancestress of the Dhanw&#257;rs, the wife of Karankot, and also the
daughter of Maiya Andhiy&#257;ri or R&#257;t Mai. She too is worshipped every third year in the dark fortnight of the month of M&#257;gh
on any Tuesday. Her sacrifice is offered in the morning hours in the forest by men only, and consists also of a black she-goat.
A site is chosen under a tree and cleaned with cowdung, the bones of animals being placed upon it in a heap to represent the
goddess. The village Baiga kills the goat with an axe and the body is eaten by the worshippers. Masw&#257;si is invoked by the
Dhanw&#257;rs before they go hunting, and whenever they kill a wild boar or a deer they offer it to her. She is thus clearly the
goddess of hunting. The tribe also worship the spirits of hills and woods and the ghosts of the illustrious dead. The ghosts
of dead Baigas or medicine-men are believed to become spirits attending on Th&#257;kur Deo, and when he is displeased with the
Dhanw&#257;rs they intervene to allay his anger. The brothers of Masw&#257;si, the twelve Gaolis, are believed to be divine hunters
and to haunt the forests, where they kill beasts and occasionally men. Six of them take post and the other six drive the beasts
or men towards these through the forest, when they are pierced as with an arrow. The victim dies after a few days, but if
human he may go to a sorcerer, who can extract the arrow, smaller than a grain of rice, from his body. In the month of Aghan
(November), when the grass of the forests is to be cut, the members of the village collectively offer a goat to the grass
deity, in order that none of the grass-cutters may be killed by a tiger or bitten by a snake or other wild animal.

<div class="div2" id="d0e12538">
<h3>10. Magic and witchcraft.</h3>
<p>The Dhanw&#257;rs are fervent believers in all kinds of magic and witchcraft. Magic is practised both by the Baiga, the village
priest or medicine-man, who is always a man and who conducts the worship of the deities mentioned above, and by the <i>tonhi</i>, the regular witch, who may be a <a id="d0e12546"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12546">498</a>]</span>man or woman. Little difference appears to exist in the methods of the two classes of magicians, but the Baiga&#8217;s magic is
usually exercised for the good of his fellow-creatures, which indeed might be expected as he gets his livelihood from them,
and he is also less powerful than the <i>tonhi</i>. The Baiga cures ordinary maladies and the bites of snakes and scorpions by mesmeric passes fortified by the utterance of
charms. He raises the dead in much the same manner as a witch does, but employs the spirit of the dead person in casting out
other evil spirits by which his clients may be possessed. One of the miracles performed by the Baiga is to make his wet cloth
stand in the air stiff and straight, holding only the two lower ends. He can cross a river walking on leaves, and change men
into beasts. Witches are not very common among the Dhanw&#257;rs. A witch, male or female, maybe detected by a sunken and gloomy
appearance of the eyes, a passionate temperament, or by being found naked in a graveyard at night, as only a witch would go
there to raise a corpse from the dead. The Dhanw&#257;rs eat nearly all kinds of food except beef and the leavings of others. They
will take cooked food from the hands of Kawars, and the men also from Gonds, but not the women. In some places they will accept
food from Br&#257;hmans, but not everywhere. They are not an impure caste, but usually live in a separate hamlet of their own,
and are lower than the Gonds and Kawars, who will take water from them but not food. They are a very primitive people, and
it is stated that at the census several of them left their huts and fled into the jungle, and were with difficulty induced
to return. When an elder man dies his family usually abandon their hut, as it is believed that his spirit haunts it and causes
death to any one who lives there.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12551">
<h3>11. Social rules.</h3>
<p>A Kawar is always permitted to become a Dhanw&#257;r, and a woman of the Gond, Binjhw&#257;r and R&#257;wat tribes, if such a one is living
with a Dhanw&#257;r, may be married to him with the approval of the tribe. She does not enjoy the full status of membership herself,
but it is accorded to her children. When an outsider is to be admitted a <i>panch&#257;yat</i> of five Dhanw&#257;rs is assembled, one of whom must be of the M&#257;jhi sept. The members of the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> hold out their <a id="d0e12562"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12562">499</a>]</span>right hands, palm upwards, one below the other, and beneath them the candidate and his wife place their hands. The M&#257;jhi pours
water from a brass vessel on to the topmost hand, and it trickles down from one to the other on to those of the candidate
and his wife. The blood of a slaughtered goat is mixed with the water in their palms and they sip it, and after giving a feast
to the caste are considered as Dhanw&#257;rs. Permanent exclusion from caste is imposed only for living with a man or woman of
another caste other than those who may become Dhanw&#257;rs, or for taking food from a member of an impure caste, the only ones
which are lower than the Dhanw&#257;rs. Temporary exclusion for an indefinite period is awarded for an irregular connection between
a Dhanw&#257;r man and woman, or of a Dhanw&#257;r with a Kawar, Binjhw&#257;r, R&#257;wat or Gond; on a family which harbours any one of its
members who has been permanently expelled; and on a woman who cuts the navel-cord of a newly-born child, whether of her own
caste or not. Irregular sexual intimacies are usually kept secret and condoned by marriage whenever possible. A person expelled
for any of the above offences cannot claim readmission as a right. He must first please the members of the caste, and to do
this he attends every caste feast without being invited, removes their leaf-plates with the leavings of food, and waits on
them generally, and continually proffers his prayer for readmission. When the other Dhanw&#257;rs are satisfied with his long and
faithful service they take him back into the community. Temporary exclusion from caste, with the penalty of one or more feasts
for readmission, is imposed for killing a cow or a cat accidentally, or in the course of giving it a beating; for having a
cow or bullock in one&#8217;s possession whose nostrils or ears get split; for getting maggots in a wound; for being beaten except
by a Government official; for taking food from any higher caste other than those from whom food is accepted; and in the case
of a woman for saying her husband&#8217;s name aloud. This list of offences shows that the Dhanw&#257;rs have almost completely adopted
the Hindu code in social matters, while retaining their tribal religion. A person guilty of one of the above offences must
have his or her head shaved by a barber, and make a pilgrimage to <a id="d0e12564"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12564">500</a>]</span>the shrine of Narsingh N&#257;th in Bod&#257;s&#257;mar zam&#299;nd&#257;ri; after having accomplished this he is purified by one of the Sonw&#257;ni sept,
being given water in which gold has been dipped to drink through a bamboo tube, and he provides usually three feasts for the
caste-fellows.

<div class="div2" id="d0e12566">
<h3>12. Dress and tattooing.</h3>
<p>The tribe dress in the somewhat primitive fashion prevalent in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, and there is nothing distinctive about their
clothing. Women are tattooed at their parents&#8217; house before or just after marriage. It is said that the tattoo marks remain
on the soul after death, and that she shows them to God, probably for purposes of identification. There is a saying, &#8216;All
other pleasures are transient, but the tattoo marks are my companions through life.&#8217; A Dhanw&#257;r will not take water from a
woman who is not tattooed.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12571">
<h3>13. Names of children.</h3>
<p>Children are named on the <i>chathi</i> or sixth day after birth, and the parents always ascertain from a wise man whether the soul of any dead relative has been
born again in the child so that they may name it after him. It is also thought that the sex may change in transmigration,
for male children are sometimes named after women relatives and female after men. Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l notes the following instance
of the names of four children in a family. The eldest was named after his grandfather; the second was called Bh&#257;lu or bear,
as his maternal uncle who had been eaten by a bear was reborn in him; the third was called Gh&#257;si, the name of a low caste
of grass-cutters, because the two children born before him had died; and the fourth was called Kausi, because the sorcerer
could not identify the spirit of any relative as having been born again in him. The name Kausi is given to any one who cannot
remember his sept, as in the saying, &#8216;<i lang="und">Bh&#363;le bis&#257;re kausi got</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;A man who has got no <i>got</i> belongs to the Kausi <i>got</i>.&#8217; Kausi is said to mean a stranger. Bad names are commonly given to avert ill-luck or premature death, as Boya, a liar; Labdu,
one smeared with ashes; Marha, a corpse; or after some physical defect as Lati, one with clotted hair; Petwa, a stammerer;
Lendra, shy; Ghundu, one who cannot walk; Ghunari, stunted; or from the place of birth, as Dongariha or Pah&#257;ru, born on a
hill; Banjariha, born in brushwood, and so on. A man will not mention the names of his wife, his son&#8217;s wife or his <a id="d0e12588"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12588">501</a>]</span>sister&#8217;s son&#8217;s wife, and a woman will not name her husband or his elder brother or parents. As already stated, a woman saying
her husband&#8217;s name aloud is temporarily put out of caste, the Hindu custom being thus carried to extremes, as is often the
case among the lower castes.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12590">
<h3>14. Occupation.</h3>
<p>The tribe consider hunting to have been their proper calling, but many of them are now cultivators and labourers. They also
make bamboo matting and large baskets for storing grain, but they will not make small bamboo baskets or fans, because this
is the calling of the Turis, on whom the Dhanw&#257;r looks down. The women collect the leaves of <i>s&#257;l</i><a id="d0e12597src" href="#d0e12597" class="noteref">6</a> trees and sell them at the rate of about ten bundles for a pice (farthing) for use as <i>chongis</i> or leaf-pipes. As already stated, the tribe have no language of their own, but speak a corrupt form of Chhatt&#299;sgarhi.

<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Dh&#299;mar, Kah&#257;r, Bhoi, P&#257;lew&#257;r, Baraua, Machhandar.</b>&#8212;The caste of fishermen and palanquin-bearers. In 1911 the Dh&#299;mars numbered 284,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r,
being most numerous in the Mar&#257;tha Districts. In the north of the Province we find in place of the Dh&#299;mars the Kah&#257;rs and
Mull&#257;hs, and in the east or Chhatt&#299;sgarh country the Kewats. But the distinction between these castes is no more than nominal,
for in some localities both Kah&#257;r and Kewat are returned as subcastes of Dh&#299;mar. In some parts of India the Bhois and Dh&#299;mars
are considered as separate castes, but in the Central Provinces they are not to be distinguished, both names being applied
indiscriminately to the same persons. The name of Bhoi perhaps belongs more particularly to those who carry litters or palanquins,
and that of Dh&#299;mar to the fishermen. The word Dh&#299;mar is a corruption of the Sanskrit Dh&#299;vara, a fisherman. Bhoi is a South
Indian word (Telugu and Malayalam <i>boyi</i>, Tamil <i>bovi</i>), and in the Konkan people of this class are known as Kah&#257;r Bhui. Among the Gonds Bhoi is considered <a id="d0e12691"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12691">503</a>]</span>as an honorific name or title; and this indicates that a large number of Gonds have become enrolled in the Dh&#299;mar or Kah&#257;r
caste, and consider it a rise in status. P&#257;lew&#257;r is the name of the Telugu fishermen of Ch&#257;nda. Machhandar signifies one who
catches fish.

<div class="div2" id="d0e12697">
<h3>2. Subcastes.</h3>
<p>The caste has a large number of subdivisions of a local or occupational nature; among occupational names may be mentioned
the Singaria or those who cultivate the <i>sing&#257;ra</i> nut, the Nadha or those who live on the banks of streams, the T&#257;nkiw&#257;las or sharpeners of grindstones, the Jh&#299;ngas or prawn-catchers,
the Bansias and Saraias or anglers (from <i>bansi</i> or <i>sarai</i>, a bamboo fishing-rod), the Bandhaiyas or those who make ropes and sacking of hemp and fibre, and the Dhurias who sell parched
rice. These last say that their original ancestors were created by Mah&#257;deo out of a handful of dust (<i>dh&#363;r</i>) for carrying the palanquin of P&#257;rvati when she was tired. They are probably the same people as the Dhuris who also parch
grain, and in Chhatt&#299;sgarh are considered as a separate caste. Similarly the Sonjhara Dh&#299;mars wash for gold, the calling of
the separate Sonjhara caste. The Kasdhonia Dh&#299;mars wash the sands of the sacred rivers to find the coins which pious pilgrims
frequently drop or throw into the river as an offering when they bathe in it. The Gondia subcaste is clearly an offshoot from
the Gond tribe, but a large proportion of the whole caste in the Central Provinces is probably derived from the Gonds or Kols,
members of this latter tribe being especially proficient as palanquin-bearers. The Suvarha subcaste is named after the <i>suar</i> or pig, because members of this subcaste breed and eat the unclean animal; they are looked down on by the others. Similarly
the Gadhew&#257;le Dh&#299;mars keep donkeys, and are despised by the other subcastes who will not take food from them. They use donkeys
for carrying loads of wood, and the bridegroom rides to his wedding on this animal; and among them a donkey is the only animal
the corpse of which can be touched without conveying pollution. The Bhan&#257;re Dh&#299;mars appear to be named after the town of Bhand&#257;ra.

<div class="div2" id="d0e12717">
<h3>3. Exogamous groups.</h3>
<p>A large number of exogamous groups are also returned, either of a titular or totemistic nature: such are B&#257;ghm&#257;r, a <a id="d0e12722"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12722">504</a>]</span>tiger-slayer; Ojhwa, from Ojha, or sorcerer; Guru pahch&#257;n, one who knows his teacher; Midoia, a guardian of boundaries, from
<i>med</i>, a boundary or border; Gidhwe, a vulture; Kolhe, or jackal; Gadhekh&#257;ya, a donkey-eater; and Kast&#363;re, musk; a few names are
from towns or villages, as Tumsare from Tumsar, N&#257;gpurkar from N&#257;gpur; and a few from other castes as M&#257;dgi, Bhoyar, Pind&#257;ria
from Pind&#257;ri, a freebooter; Gondia (Gond) and Gondhali; and Kachhw&#257;ha, a sept of R&#257;jp&#363;ts.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12727">
<h3>4. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Marriage is prohibited between members of the same sept and also between first cousins. In many localities families do not
intermarry so long as they remember any relationship to have existed between them. In Mandla, Mr. Govind Moreshwar states,
the Nadha and Kehera subcastes do not intermarry; but if a man desires a girl of the other subcaste he can be admitted into
it on giving a feast to the caste-fellows according to his means, and thus marry her. Two families may exchange daughters
in marriage. A maiden who goes wrong with a man of the caste or of any higher caste may be readmitted to the community under
penalty of a feast to the caste and of having a lock of her hair cut off. In the Hindust&#257;ni Districts women do not accompany
the marriage procession, but in the Mar&#257;tha Districts they do. Among the Bhan&#257;ra Dh&#299;mars of Ch&#257;nda the wedding may be held
either at the bride&#8217;s or the bridegroom&#8217;s house. In the former case a bride-price of Rs. 16 is paid, and in the latter one
of Rs. 20, because the expenses of the bride&#8217;s family are increased if the wedding is held at her house. A custom exists among
the poorer Dh&#299;mars in Ch&#257;nda of postponing the marriage ceremony to avoid expense; a man will thus simply take a girl for
his wife, making a payment of Rs. 1&#8211;4 or twenty pence to her father and giving a feast to the community. She will then live
in his house as his wife, and at some subsequent date, perhaps in old age, the religious ceremony will be held so that the
couple may have been properly married before they die. In this fashion the weddings of grandparents, parents and children
have all been celebrated simultaneously. The Singaria Dh&#299;mars of Chhindw&#257;ra grow <i>sing&#257;ra</i> or water-nut in tanks, and at their weddings a crocodile must be killed <a id="d0e12735"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12735">505</a>]</span>and eaten. The Sonjharas or gold-washers must also have a crocodile, but they keep it alive and worship it, and when the ceremony
is concluded let it go back again to the river. It is natural that castes whose avocations are connected with rivers and tanks
should in a manner deify the most prominent or most ferocious animal contained in their waters. And the ceremonial eating
of a sacred animal has been recorded among divers peoples all over the world. At a Dh&#299;mar marriage in Bhand&#257;ra a net is given
to the bridegroom, and <i>sidori</i> or cooked food, tied in a piece of cloth, to the bride, and they walk out together as if going to a river to fish, but the
bride&#8217;s brother comes up and stops them. After a wedding in Mandla they kill a pig and bury it before the door of the bridegroom&#8217;s
house, covering it with earth, and the bride and bridegroom step over its body into the house. Widow-marriage is freely permitted;
in Mandla the marriage of a widow may be held on the night of any day except Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday. Divorce is allowed,
but is of rare occurrence. Adultery on the part of a wife will be frequently overlooked, and the extreme step of divorcing
her is only taken if she creates a public scandal. In such a case the parties appear before a meeting of the caste, and the
headman asks them whether they have determined to separate. He then breaks a straw in token of the disruption of the union,
and the husband and wife must pronounce each other&#8217;s names in an audible voice.<a id="d0e12740src" href="#d0e12740" class="noteref">2</a> A fee of Rs. 1&#8211;4 is paid to the headman, and the divorce is completed.<a id="d0e12743src" href="#d0e12743" class="noteref">3</a> In some localities the woman&#8217;s bangles are also broken. In Jh&#257;nsi the fine for keeping a widow is ten rupees and for living
with the wife of another man sixty rupees.

<h3>5. Childbirth</h3>
<p>Children are named either on the day of birth or the twelfth day afterwards. The women place the child in a cradle, spreading
boiled wheat and gram over its body, and after swinging it to and fro the name is given. Sweets or boiled wheat and gram are
distributed to those present. In Ber&#257;r on the third day after a birth cakes of ju&#257;ri flour and buttermilk are distributed
to other children; on the fifth <a id="d0e12751"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12751">506</a>]</span>day the slab and roller used for grinding the household corn are washed, anointed and worshipped; on the twelfth day the child

<h3>6. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
<p>The bodies of the dead are usually buried, cremation being beyond the means of Dh&#299;mars. Children whose ears have not been
pierced are mourned only for one day, and others for ten days. When a body has been burnt the ashes are consigned to a tank
or river on the third day, or if the third day be a Sunday or a Wednesday, then on the fifth day. In Ber&#257;r, Mr. Kitts remarks,<a id="d0e12767src" href="#d0e12767" class="noteref">5</a> the funeral ceremony of the Dh&#299;mars resembles that of the Gonds. After a burial the mourners repair to the deceased&#8217;s house
to drink; and subsequently each fetches his own dinner and dines with the chief mourner. At this time he and his family are
impure and the others cannot take food prepared by him; but ten days afterwards when the mourning is over and the chief mourner
has bathed and shaved they again dine with him, and on the next day the caste is feasted. During the period of mourning a
lighted lamp is daily placed outside the house. When the period of mourning expires all the clothes of the family are washed
and their house is newly whitewashed. There is no subsequent annual performance of funeral rites as among the higher Hindus;
but at the Akshayatritiya or commencement of the agricultural year the head of the household throws at each meal a little
food into the fire, in honour of his dead ancestors.

<div class="div2" id="d0e12774">
<h3>7. Religion.</h3>
<p>One of the principal deities of the Dh&#299;mars<a id="d0e12779src" href="#d0e12779" class="noteref">6</a> as of other low castes is Dulha Deo, the deified bridegroom. They fashion his image of <i>kadamb</i><a id="d0e12788src" href="#d0e12788" class="noteref">7</a> wood and besmear it with red lead. In Ber&#257;r they also pray to Anna P&#363;rna, the Corn-giving goddess of Madras corresponding
to Durga or Devi, whose form with that of her horse is engraved on a brass plate and anointed with yellow and red turmeric.
When about to enter a river or tank for fishing or other purposes they pray to the water-god to save them from being drowned
or molested by its denizens. They address a river as Ganga Mai or &#8216;Mother Ganges&#8217; in order to <a id="d0e12792"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12792">507</a>]</span>propitiate it by this flattery. Those who are employed on ferry-boats especially venerate Ghatoia<a id="d0e12794src" href="#d0e12794" class="noteref">8</a> Deo, the god of ferries and river-crossings. His shrine is near the place where the boats are tied up, and ferry contractors
keep a live chicken in their boat to be offered to Ghatoia on the first occasion when the river is sufficiently in flood to
be crossed by ferry after the breaking of the rains. Other local godlings are the Bare Purakh or Great men, a collective term
for their deceased ancestors, of whom they make silver images; Parih&#257;r, the soul of the village priest; Baram Deo, the spirit
of the banyan tree; and Gosain Deo, a deified ascetic. To the goddess Devi they offer a black she-goat which is eaten ceremonially,
and when they have finished, the bones, skin and all the other remains of the animal are placed in a pit inside the house.
If anything should fall into this pit it must be buried with the remains of the offering and not taken out. And they relate
that on one occasion a child fell into the pit, and the parents, setting obedience to the law of the goddess above the life
of their child, buried it alive. But next year when the sacrifice was again made and the pit was opened, the child was found
in it alive and playing. So they say that the goddess will save the life of any one who is buried in the pit with her offering.
When a widower marries a second time his wife sometimes wears a <i>t&#257;wiz</i> or amulet in the shape of a silver box containing charms round her neck in order to ward off the evil machinations of her
predecessor&#8217;s spirit.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12803">
<h3>8. Occupation: fisherman.</h3>
<p>The occupations of the Dh&#299;mar are many and various. He is primarily a fisherman and boatman, and has various kinds of nets
for taking fish. One of these is of triangular shape about 150 feet wide at the base and 80 feet in height to the apex. The
meshes vary from an inch wide at the top to three inches at the bottom. The ends of the base are weighted with stones and
the net is then sunk into a river so that the base rests on its bed and the top is held by men in boats at the surface. Then
other Dh&#299;mars beat the surface of the water for some distance with long bamboos on both sides of the net, driving the fish
towards it. They <a id="d0e12808"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12808">508</a>]</span>call this a <i>kheda</i>, the term used for a beat of the forest for game.

</p>
<p>Another method is to stretch a long rope or cord across the river, secured on either bank, with baited hooks attached to it
at short intervals. It is left for some hours and then drawn in. When the river is shallow one wide-bottomed boat will be
paddled up the stream and a line of men will wade on each side beating the water with bamboos so as to make the small fish
jump into the boat. Or they put a little cotton-seed on a stone in shallow water, and when the fish collect to eat the seed
a long circular net weighted with pieces of iron is let down over the stone. Then the upper end is drawn tight and the fishermen
put their hands inside and seize the little fish. The Dh&#299;mar is also regularly employed as a worker on ferries. His primitive
boat made from the hollowed trunk of a tree and sometimes lashed in couples for greater stability may still be seen on all
rivers. He makes his own fishing-nets, knitting them on a stick at his leisure while he is walking along or sitting down to
smoke and talk. He worships his fishing-nets at the Diw&#257;li festival, and his reverence for the knitted thread is such that
he will not touch or wear a shoe made of thread, because he thinks that the sacred article is debased by being sewn into leather.
When engaged in road-work the Dh&#299;mars have unsewn sandals secured to the feet with strips of leather. It is a special degradation
to a Dh&#299;mar to be struck with a shoe. He has a monopoly of growing <i>sing&#257;ra</i><a id="d0e12817src" href="#d0e12817" class="noteref">9</a> or water-nuts in tanks. The fruit of this plant has a taste somewhat between a cocoanut and a potato, with a flavour of soap.
It can be taken raw and is therefore a favourite comestible for fast days when cooked food is forbidden. It is also sold at
railway stations and the fresh fruit is prescribed by village doctors as easy of digestion. The Dh&#299;mar grows melons, cucumbers
and other vegetables on the sandy stretches along the banks of streams, but at agriculture proper he does not excel.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12821">
<h3>9. Water-carrier.</h3>
<p>The Dh&#299;mar&#8217;s connection with water has led to his becoming the water-carrier for Hindus, or that section of the community
which can afford to employ one. This is <a id="d0e12826"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12826">509</a>]</span>more especially the case in the Hindust&#257;ni Districts where women are frequently secluded and therefore cannot draw water for
the household, while in the Mar&#257;tha Districts where the women go to the well no water-bearer is required. In this capacity
the Dh&#299;mar is usually the personal servant of the village proprietor, but in large villages every house has a <i>ghinochi</i>, either an earthen platform or wooden stand just outside the house, on which four or five earthen water-pots are kept. These
the Dh&#299;mar fills up morning and evening and receives two or three annas or pence a month for doing so. He also brings water
for Government servants when they come to the village, and cleans their cooking-vessels and prepares the hearth with fresh
cowdung and water in order to cleanse it.

</p>
<p>If he cleans the m&#257;lguz&#257;r&#8217;s vessels he gets his food for doing so. When the tenants have marriages he performs the same duties
for the whole wedding party and receives a present of one or two rupees and some clothes if the families are well off, and
also his food every day while the marriage is in progress. In his capacity of waterman the title Baraua is used to him as
an honorific method of address; and to his wife Baroni. In a hot country like India water is revered as the source of relief,
comfort and life itself, like fire in cold countries, and the waterman participates in the regard paid to his element.

</p>
<p>Another business of the Dh&#299;mar&#8217;s is to take sweet potatoes and boiled plums to the fields at harvest-time and sell them. He
supplies water for drinking to the reapers and receives three sheaves a day in payment. On the fifteenth of Jesth (May) the
Dh&#299;mar goes round to the cultivators, throwing his fishing-net over their heads and receives a small present.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12835">
<h3>10. Palanquin-bearer and personal servant.</h3>
<p>At the period prior to the introduction of wheeled transport when palanquins or litters were largely used for travelling,
the carriers belonged to the Kah&#257;r caste in northern India and to the Dh&#299;mars or Bhois in the south. Though litters are now
practically not used for travelling except occasionally by high-caste women, a survival of the old custom is retained in the
marriage ceremony, the bride and bridegroom being always carried back from the marriage-shed to the temporary lodging of the
bridegroom in a <i>p&#257;lki</i>, <a id="d0e12843"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12843">510</a>]</span>though for the longer journey to the bridegroom&#8217;s village some less cumbrous conveyance is utilised. Four Dh&#299;mars carry the
<i>p&#257;lki</i> and receive Rs. 1&#8211;4. Well-to-do people will be carried in procession round the town. When employed by the village proprietor
the Dh&#299;mar accompanies him on his journey, carrying his cooking-vessels and other necessaries in a <i>banhgi</i> or wooden cross-bar slung across the shoulders, from which two baskets are suspended by loops of rope. Water he will always
carry in a <i>banhgi</i> and never on his head or shoulders. From waterman and litter-carrier the Dh&#299;mar has become a personal servant; it is he to
whom the term &#8216;bearer&#8217; as designating a body-servant was first applied because he bears or carries his master in a <i>p&#257;lki</i> and his clothes in a <i>banhgi</i>. He is commonly so employed in native houses, but rarely by Europeans, whether because he is too stupid or on account of
caste objections of his own. When employed as a cook the Dh&#299;mar or his wife is permitted to knead flour with water and make
it into a cake which the Br&#257;hman will then take and put on to the girdle with his own hands. He can also boil water and pour
pulse into the cooking-pot from above so long as he does not touch the vessel after the food has been placed in it. He or
she will also take any remains of food which is left in the cooking-pot as this is not considered to be polluted, food only
becoming polluted when the hand touches it on the dish after having touched the mouth. When this has happened all the food
on the dish becomes <i>j&#363;tha</i> or leavings of food, and as a general rule no caste except the sweepers will eat the leavings of food of another caste or
of another person of their own. Only the wife, whose meal follows her husband&#8217;s, will eat his leavings. As a servant the Dh&#299;mar
is very familiar with his master; he may enter any part of the house, including the cooking-place and the women&#8217;s rooms, and
he addresses his mistress as &#8216;Mother.&#8217; In northern India Mr. Crooke states that the Kah&#257;rs are sometimes known as Mahra, from
the Sanskrit Mahila, a woman, because they have the entry of the female apartments. When he lights his master&#8217;s pipe he takes
the first pull himself to show that it has not been tampered with, and then presents it to him with his left hand placed under
his <a id="d0e12863"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12863">511</a>]</span>right elbow in token of respect. Maid-servants also frequently belong to the Dh&#299;mar caste, and it often happens that the master
of the household has illicit intercourse with them. Hence there is a proverb, &#8216;The king&#8217;s son draws water and the water-bearer&#8217;s
son sits on the throne,&#8217; similar intrigues on the part of high-born women with their servants being not unknown. The Dh&#299;mar
often acts as a pimp, this being an incident of his profession of indoor servant.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12865">
<h3>11. Other occupations.</h3>
<p>Another occupation of the Dh&#299;mar&#8217;s is to sell parched grain and rice to travellers in markets and railway stations like the
Bharbh&#363;nja and Dhuri. This he can do because of his comparative social purity, as all castes will take water and cakes and
sweetmeats from his hands. Some Dh&#299;mars and Kewats also weave hemp-matting and gunny-bags, but such members of the caste rank
lower than the others and Br&#257;hmans will not take water from them. Another calling by which a few Dh&#299;mars find support is that
of breeding pigs. One would think it a difficult matter to make a living out of the village pig, an animal abhorred by both
Hindus and Muhammadans as the most unclean of the brute creation, and equally abjured by Europeans as unfit for food. But
the pig is in considerable demand by the forest tribes for sacrifice to their deities. The Dh&#299;mar participates in the sacrifice
to N&#257;r&#257;yan Deo described in the article on Mah&#257;r, when a pig is eaten in concert by several of the lower castes. Lastly, the
business of rearing the cocoons of the tasar silk-worm is usually in the hands of Dh&#299;mars and Kewats. While the caterpillars
are feeding on leaves and spinning their cocoons these men live in the forests for two months together and watch the <i>kosa-b&#257;ris</i> or silk-gardens, that is the blocks of trees which are set apart for the purpose of rearing the caterpillars. During this
period they eat only once a day, abstain from meat and lentils, do not get shaved and do not visit their wives. When the eggs
of the caterpillars are to be placed on the trees they tie a silk thread round the first tree to be used and worship it as
P&#257;t Deo or the god of silk thread. On this subject Mr. Ball writes:<a id="d0e12873src" href="#d0e12873" class="noteref">10</a> &#8220;The trees which it is intended to stock are carefully pollarded before the rains, and in early spring the leaves are stocked
<a id="d0e12878"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12878">512</a>]</span>with young caterpillars which have been hatched in the houses. The men in charge erect wigwams and remain on the spot, isolated
from their families, who regard them for the time being as unclean. During the daytime they have full occupation in guarding
the large green caterpillars from the attacks of kites and other birds. The cocoons are collected soon after they are spun
and boiled in a lye of wood-ash, and the extracted chrysalids must then be eaten by the caretakers, who have to undergo certain
ceremonial rites before they are readmitted into the society of their fellows. The effect of the boiling in the lye is the
removal of the glutinous matter, which renders it possible to wind off the silk.&#8221; The eating of the caterpillars is no doubt
a ceremonial observance like that of the crocodile at weddings. They are killed by the boiling of the cocoons and on this
account members of good castes will not engage in the business of rearing them. The abstention from conjugal intimacy while
engaged in some important business is a very common phenomenon.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12880">
<h3>12. Social status.</h3>
<p>The social status of the Dh&#299;mar is somewhat peculiar. Owing to his employment as palanquin-bearer, cook and household servant
he has been promoted to the group of castes who are ceremonially clean, so that Br&#257;hmans in northern India will take water
and food cooked in butter from his hands. But by origin he no doubt belongs to the primitive or non-Aryan tribes, a fact which
he shows by his appearance and also by his customs. In diet he is the reverse of fastidious, eating crocodiles, tortoises
and crabs, and also pork in the Mar&#257;tha Districts, though in the north where he is employed by Br&#257;hmans as a personal servant
he abstains from this food. With all this, however, the Dh&#299;mars practise in some social matters a pharasaical strictness.
In Jubbulpore Mr. Pancham L&#257;l records that among the four subcastes of Rekw&#257;r, Bant, Barmaian and Pabeha a woman of one subcaste
will not partake of any food cooked by one of another division. A man will take any kind of food cooked by a man of another
subcaste, but from a woman only such as is not mixed with water. A woman will drink the water held in the metal vessel of
a woman of another division, but not in an earthen vessel; and in a metal vessel only provided <a id="d0e12885"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12885">513</a>]</span>that it is brought straight from the well and not taken from the <i>ghinochi</i> or water-stand of such woman&#8217;s house. A man will take water to drink from the metal or earthen vessel of any other Dh&#299;mar,
male or female. In Ber&#257;r again Mr. Kitts states<a id="d0e12890src" href="#d0e12890" class="noteref">11</a> that a Bhoi considers it pollution to eat or drink at the house of a Loh&#257;r (blacksmith), a Sut&#257;r (carpenter), a Bh&#257;t (bard),
a washerman or a barber; he will not even carry their palanquins at a marriage.

</p>
<p>Once a year at the Muharram festival the Dh&#299;mars will eat at the hands of Muhammadans. They go round and beg for offerings
of food and take them to the Fak&#299;r, who places a little before the <i>t&#257;zia</i> or tomb of Husain and distributes the remainder to the Dh&#299;mars and other Hindus and Muhammadans who have been begging. Except
on this occasion they will eat nothing touched by a Muhammadan. The Dh&#299;mar, the Nai or barber, and the B&#257;ri or indoor servant
are the three household menials of the northern Districts, and are known as Pauni Parja. Sometimes the Ah&#299;r or grazier is
an indoor servant and takes the place of the Dh&#299;mar or the B&#257;ri. These menials are admitted to the wedding and other family
feasts and allowed to eat at them. They sit in a line apart from the members of the caste and one member of the family is
deputed to wait on them. Their food is brought to them in separate dishes and no food from these dishes is served to guests
of the caste.

</p>
<p>Permanent expulsion<a id="d0e12902src" href="#d0e12902" class="noteref">12</a> from caste is inflicted only for marrying, or eating regularly, with a man or woman of some other low caste; but in the case
of unmarried persons the latter offence may also be expiated. Temporary exclusion is imposed for killing a cat, dog or squirrel,
getting maggots in a wound, being sentenced to imprisonment<a id="d0e12905src" href="#d0e12905" class="noteref">13</a> or committing adultery with a person of any low caste. One who has <a id="d0e12908"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12908">514</a>]</span>committed any of the above offences must be purified by the Batta of the caste, that is a person who takes the sins of others
upon himself. The Batta conducts the culprit to a river and then causes him to bathe, cuts off a lock of his hair, breaks
a cocoanut as a sacrifice, and gives him a little cowdung and milk to eat. Then they proceed to eat together; the Batta eats
five mouthfuls first and declares that he has taken the sin of the offender on himself; the latter gives the Batta Rs. 1&#8211;4
as his fee, and is once more a proper member of the community. In Ber&#257;r a Bhoi who has been put out of caste is received back
by his fellows when he has drunk the water touched by a Br&#257;hman&#8217;s toe, and has feasted them with a bout of liquor. In towns
the caste are generally addicted to drink, and no marriage or other social function is held without a sufficient supply of
liquor. They also smoke <i>g&#257;nja</i> (Indian hemp).

<div class="div2" id="d0e12913">
<h3>13. Legend of the caste.</h3>
<p>The Dh&#299;mars are proverbially of a cheerful disposition, though simple and easily cheated. When carrying <i>p&#257;lkis</i> or litters at night they talk continually or sing monotonous songs to lighten the tedium of the way. In illustration of these
qualities the following story is told: One day when Mah&#257;deo and P&#257;rvati were travelling the goddess became very tired, so
Mah&#257;deo created four men from the dust, who bore her in a litter. On the way they talked and laughed, and P&#257;rvati was very
pleased with them, so when she got home she told them to wait while she sent them out a reward. The Bhois found that they
could get plenty of liquor, so they went on drinking it and forgot all about going for the reward. In the meantime a M&#257;rw&#257;ri
Bania who had heard what the goddess said, waited at the door of the palace, and when the servants brought out a bag of money
he pretended that he was one of the Bhois and got them to give him the money, with which he made off. After a time the Bhois
remembered about the reward and went to the door of the palace to get it, when the goddess came out and found out what had
happened. The Bhois then wept and asked for another reward, but the goddess refused and said that as they had been so stupid
their caste would always be poor, but at the same time they would be cheerful and happy.

have little or no connection with ordinary morality. But in Jh&#257;nsi Mr. Crooke remarks that a Kah&#257;r is put out of caste for
theft in his master&#8217;s house. This again, however, might be considered as an offence against the community, tending to lower
their corporate character in their business, and as such deserving of social punishment.

<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Dhoba.</b><a id="d0e12964src" href="#d0e12964" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A small caste belonging to the Mandla District and apparently an offshoot from one of the primitive tribes. They have never
been separately classified at the census but always amalgamated with the Dhobi or washerman caste. But the Mandla Dhobas acknowledge
no connection with Dhobis, nor has any been detected. One Dhoba has indeed furnished a story to the Rev. E. Price that the
first ancestor of the caste was a foundling boy, by appearance of good lineage, who was brought up by some Dhobis, and, marrying
a Dhobi girl, made a new caste. But this is not sufficient to demonstrate the common origin of the Dhobas and Dhobis. The
Dhobas reside principally in a few villages in the upper valley of the Burhner River, and members of the caste own two or
three villages. They are dark in complexion and have, though in a less degree, the flat features, coarse nose and receding
forehead of the Gond; but they are taller in stature and not so strongly built, and are much less capable of exertion.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12970">
<h3>2. Exogamous divisions.</h3>
<p>The caste has twelve exogamous septs, though the list is probably not complete. These appear to be derived from the names
of villages. Marriage is forbidden between the B&#257;ghm&#257;r and B&#257;ghcharia septs, the Mar&#257;tha and Khatn&#257;gar and Mar&#257;lwati septs
and the Sonw&#257;ni and <a id="d0e12975"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12975">516</a>]</span>Sonsonw&#257;ni septs. These septs are said to have been subdivided and to be still related. The names B&#257;ghm&#257;r and B&#257;ghcharia are
both derived from the tiger; Sonnw&#257;ni is from Sona-p&#257;ni or gold-water, and the Sonsonw&#257;ni sept seems therefore to be the aristocratic
branch or <i>cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</i> of the Sonw&#257;nis. The children of brothers and sisters may marry but not those of two sisters, because a man&#8217;s maternal aunt
or <i>mausi</i> is considered as equivalent to his mother. A man may also marry his step-sister on the mother&#8217;s side, that is the daughter
of his own mother by another husband either prior to or subsequent to his father, the step-sister being of a different sept.
This relaxation may have been permitted on account of the small numbers of the caste and the consequent difficulty of arranging
marriages.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12983">
<h3>3. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>The bridegroom goes to the bride&#8217;s house for the wedding, which is conducted according to the Hindu ritual of walking round
the sacred post. The cost of a marriage in a fairly well-to-do family, including the betrothal, may be about Rs. 140, of which
a quarter falls on the bride&#8217;s people. Divorce and the remarriage of widows are permitted. A pregnant woman stops working
after six months and goes into retirement. After a birth the woman is impure for five or six days. She does not appear in
public for a month, and takes no part in outdoor occupations or field-work until the child is weaned, that is six months after
its birth.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12988">
<h3>4. Funeral rites.</h3>
<p>The dead are usually buried, and all members of the dead man&#8217;s sept are considered to be impure. After the funeral they bathe
and come home and have their food cooked for them by other Dhobas, partaking of it in the dead man&#8217;s house. On the ninth,
eleventh or thirteenth day, when the impurity ends, the male members of the sept are shaved on the bank of a river and the
hair is left lying there. When they start home they spread some thorns and two stones across the path. Then, as the first
man steps over the thorns, he takes up one of the stones in his hand and passes it behind him to the second, and each man
successively passes it back as he steps over the thorns, the last man throwing the stone behind the thorns. Thus the dead
man&#8217;s spirit in the shape of the stone is separated from <a id="d0e12993"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e12993">517</a>]</span>the living and prevented from accompanying them home. Then a feast is held, all the men of the dead man&#8217;s sept sitting opposite
to the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> at a distance of three feet. Next day water in which gold has been dipped is thrown over the dead man&#8217;s house and each member
of the sept drinks a little and is pure.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e12998">
<h3>5. Caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> and social penalties.
</h3>
<p>The head of the caste is always a member of the Sonw&#257;ni sept and is known as R&#257;ja. It is his business to administer water
in which gold has been dipped (<i>sona-p&#257;ni</i>) to offenders as a means of purification, and from this the name of the sept is derived. The R&#257;ja has no deputy, and officiates
in all ceremonies of the caste; he receives no contribution from the caste, but a double share of food and sweetmeats when
they are distributed. The other members of the Panch he is at liberty to choose from any <i>got</i> or sept he likes. When a man has been put out of caste for a serious offence he has to give three feasts for readmission.
The first meal consists of a goat with rice and pulse, and is eaten on the bank of a stream; on this occasion the head of
the offender is shaved clean and all the hair thrown into the stream. The second meal is eaten in the yard of his house, and
consists of cakes fried in butter with rice and pulse. The offender is not allowed to partake of either the first or second
meal. On the third day the R&#257;ja gives the offender gold-water, and he is then considered to be purified and cooks food himself,
which the caste-people eat with him in his house. A man is not put out of caste when he is sent to jail, as this is considered
to be an order of the Government. A man keeping a woman of another caste is expelled and not reinstated until he has put her
away, and even then it is said that they will consider his character before taking him back. A man who gets maggots in a wound
may be readmitted to caste only during the months of Chait and P&#363;s.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13012">
<h3>6. Occupation and social customs.</h3>
<p>The Dhobas act as priests of the Gonds and are also cultivators. Their social position is distinctly higher than that of the
Gonds and some of them have begun to employ Br&#257;hmans for their ceremonies. They will eat the flesh of most animals, except
those of the cow-tribe, and also field-mice, and most of them drink liquor, though the more prominent <a id="d0e13017"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13017">518</a>]</span>members have begun to abstain. The origin of the caste is very obscure, but it would appear that they must be an offshoot
of one of the Dravidian tribes. In this connection it is interesting to note that Chhatt&#299;sgarh contains a large number of
Dhobis, though the people of this tract have until recently worn little in the way of clothing, and usually wash it themselves
when this operation is judged necessary. Many of the Dhobis of Chhatt&#299;sgarh are cultivators, and it seems possible that a
proportion of them may also really belong to this Dhoba caste.

<h3>1. Character and structure of the caste.</h3>
<p><b>Dhobi, W&#257;rthi, Baretha, Chakla, Rajak, Parit.</b>&#8212;The professional caste of washermen. The name is derived from the Hindi <i>dhona</i>, and the Sanskrit <i>dhav</i>, to wash. W&#257;rthi is the Mar&#257;tha name for the caste, and Bareth or Baretha is an honorific or complimentary term of address.
Rajak and Parit are synonyms, the latter being used in the Mar&#257;tha Districts. The Chakla caste of Madras are leather-workers,
but in Ch&#257;nda a community of persons is found who are known as Chakla and are professional washermen. In 1911 the Dhobis numbered
165,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r, or one to every hundred inhabitants. They are numerous in the Districts
with large towns and also in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, where, like the Dhobas of Bengal, they have to a considerable extent abandoned
their hereditary profession and taken to cultivation and other callings. No account worth reproduction has been obtained of
the origin of the caste. In the Central Provinces it is purely functional, as is shown by its subdivisions; these are generally
of a territorial nature, and indicate that the Dhobis like the other professional castes have come here from all parts of
the country. Instances of the subcastes are: Baonia and Ber&#257;ria from Ber&#257;r; M&#257;lwi, Bundelkhandi, Nim&#257;ria, Kanaujia, Udaipuria
from Udaipur; Madrasi, Dharampuria from Dharampur, and so on. A separate subcaste is formed of <a id="d0e13079"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13079">520</a>]</span>Muhammadan Dhobis. The exogamous groups known as <i>khero</i> are of the usual low-caste type, taking their names from villages or titular or professional terms.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13084">
<h3>2. Marriage customs.</h3>
<p>Marriage within the <i>khero</i> is prohibited and also the union of first cousins. It is considered disgraceful to accept a price for a bride, and it is
said that this is not done even by the parents of poor girls, but the caste will in such cases raise a subscription to defray
the expenses of her marriage. In the northern Districts the marriages of Dhobis are characterised by continuous singing and
dancing at the houses of the bridegroom and bride, these performances being known as <i>sajnai</i> and <i>birha</i>. Some man also puts on a long coat, tight down to the waist and loose round the hips, to have the appearance of a dancing-girl,
and dances before the party, while two or three other men play. Mr. Crooke considers that this ritual, which is found also
among other low castes, resembles the European custom of the False Bride and is intended to divert the evil eye from the real
bride. He writes:<a id="d0e13098src" href="#d0e13098" class="noteref">1</a> &#8220;Now there are numerous customs which have been grouped in Europe under the name of the False Bride. Thus among the Esthonians
the false bride is enacted by the bride&#8217;s brother dressed in woman&#8217;s clothes; in Polonia by a bearded man called the Wilde
Braut; in Poland by an old woman veiled in white and lame; again among the Esthonians by an old woman with a brickwork crown;
in Brittany, where the substitutes are first a little girl, then the mistress of the house, and lastly the grandmother.

</p>
<p>&#8220;The supposition may then be hazarded in the light of the Indian examples that some one assumes on this occasion the part
of the bride in order to divert on himself from her the envious glance of the evil eye.&#8221; Any further information on this interesting
custom would be welcome.

</p>
<p>The remarriage of widows is allowed, and in Bet&#363;l the bridegroom goes to the widow&#8217;s house on a dark night wrapped up in a
black blanket, and presents the widow with new clothes and bangles, and spangles and red lead for the forehead. Divorce is
permitted with the approval of the caste headman by the execution of a deed on stamped paper.
<a id="d0e13107"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13107">521</a>]</span>


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13109">
<h3>3. Other social customs.</h3>
<p>After a birth the mother is allowed no food for some days except country sugar and dates. The child is given some honey and
castor-oil for the first two days and is then allowed to suckle the mother. A pit is dug inside the lying-in room, and in
this are deposited water and the first cuttings of the nails and hair of the child. It is filled up and on her recovery the
mother bows before it, praying for similar safe deliveries in future and for the immunity of the child from physical ailments.
After the birth of a male child the mother is impure for seven days and for five days after that of a female.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13114">
<h3>4. Religion.</h3>
<p>The principal deity of the Dhobis is Ghatoia, the god of the <i>gh&#257;t</i> or landing-place on the river to which they go to wash their clothes. Libations of liquor are made to him in the month of
As&#257;rh (June), when the rains break and the rivers begin to be flooded. Before entering the water to wash the clothes they
bow to the stone on which these are beaten out, asking that their work may be quickly finished; and they also pray to the
river deity to protect them from snakes and crocodiles. They worship the stone on the Dasahra festival, making an offering
to it of flowers, turmeric and cooked food. The Dhobi&#8217;s washing-stone is believed to be haunted by the ghosts of departed
Dhobis when revisiting the glimpses of the moon, and is held to have magical powers. If a man requires a love-charm he should
steal a <i>sup&#257;ri</i> or areca-nut from the baz&#257;r at night or on the occasion of an eclipse. The same night he goes to the Dhobi&#8217;s stone and sets
the nut upon it. He breaks an egg and a cocoanut over the stone and burns incense before it. Then he takes the nut away and
gives it to the woman of his fancy, wrapped up in betel-leaf, and she will love him. Their chief festivals are the Holi and
Diw&#257;li, at which they drink a great deal. The dead are buried or burnt as may be convenient, and mourning is observed for
three days only, the family being purified on the Sunday or Wednesday following the death. They have a caste committee whose
president is known as Mehtar, while other officials are the Chaudhri or vice-president, and the Badkur, who appoints dates
for the penal feasts and issues the summons to the caste-fellows. These posts are hereditary and their holders <a id="d0e13125"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13125">522</a>]</span>receive presents of a rupee and a cloth when members of the caste have to give expiatory feasts.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13127">
<h3>5. Occupation: washing clothes.</h3>
<p>Before washing his clothes the Dhobi steams them,<a id="d0e13132src" href="#d0e13132" class="noteref">2</a> hanging them in a bundle for a time over a cauldron of boiling water. After this he takes them to a stream or pond and washes
them roughly with fuller&#8217;s earth. The washerman steps nearly knee-deep into the water, and taking a quantity of clothes by
one end in his two hands he raises them aloft in the air and brings them down heavily upon a huge stone slab, grooved, at
his feet. This threshing operation he repeats until his clothes are perfectly clean. In Saugor the clothes are rubbed with
wood-ashes at night and beaten out in water with a stick in the morning. Silk clothes are washed with the nut of the <i>r&#299;tha</i> tree (<i>Sapindus emarginatus</i>) which gives a lather like soap. Sir H. Risley writes of the Dacca washermen:<a id="d0e13144src" href="#d0e13144" class="noteref">3</a> &#8220;For washing muslins and other coloured garments well or spring water is alone used; but if the articles are the property
of a poor man or are commonplace, the water of the nearest tank or river is accounted sufficiently good. Indigo is in as general
use as in England for removing the yellowish tinge and whitening the material. The water of the wells and springs bordering
on the red laterite formation on the north of the city has been for centuries celebrated, and the old bleaching fields of
the European factories were all situated in this neighbourhood. Various plants are used by the Dhobis to clarify water such
as the <i>nirmali</i> (<i>Strychnos potatorum</i>), the <i>piu</i> (<i>Basella</i>), the <i>n&#257;gphani</i> (<i>Cactus indicus</i>) and several plants of the mallow family. Alum, though not much valued, is sometimes used.&#8221; In most Districts of the Central
Provinces the Dhobi is employed as a village servant and is paid by annual contributions of grain from the cultivators. For
ordinary washing he gets half as much as the blacksmith or carpenter, or 13 to 20 lbs. of grain annually from each householder,
with about another 10 lbs. at seedtime or harvest. When he brings the clothes home he also receives a meal or a <i>chap&#257;ti</i>, and well-to-do persons give him their old clothes as a present. In return for this he washes all the clothes of the family
two or three times a month, except the loin-cloths <a id="d0e13170"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13170">523</a>]</span>and women&#8217;s bodices which they themselves wash daily. The Dhobi is also employed on the occasion of a birth or a death. These
events cause impurity and hence all the clothes of all the members of the family must be washed when the impurity ceases.
In Saugor when a man dies the Dhobi receives eight annas and for a woman four annas, and similar rates in the case of the
birth of a male or female child. When the first son is born in a family the Dhobi and barber place a brass vessel on the top
of a pole and tie a flag to it as a cloth and take it round to all the friends and relations of the family, announcing the
event. They receive presents of grain and money which they expend on a drinking-bout.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13172">
<h3>6. Social position.</h3>
<p>The Dhobi is considered to be impure, and he is not allowed to come into the houses of the better castes nor to touch their
water-vessels. In Saugor he may come as far as the veranda but not into the house. His status would in any case be low as
a village menial, but he is specially degraded, Mr. Crooke states, by his task of washing the clothes of women after child-birth
and his consequent association with puerperal blood, which is particularly abhorred. Formerly a Br&#257;hman did not let the Dhobi
wash his clothes, or, if he did, they were again steeped in water in the house as a means of purification. Now he contents
himself with sprinkling the clean clothes with water in which a piece of gold has been dipped. The Dhobi is not so impure
as the Cham&#257;r and Basor, and if a member of the higher castes touches him inadvertently it is considered sufficient to wash
the face and hands only and not the clothes.

</p>
<p>Colonel Tod writes<a id="d0e13179src" href="#d0e13179" class="noteref">4</a> that in R&#257;jput&#257;na the washermen&#8217;s wells dug at the sides of streams are deemed the most impure of all receptacles. And one
of the most binding oaths is that a man as he swears should drop a pebble into one of these wells, saying, &#8220;If I break this
oath may all the good deeds of my forefathers fall into the washerman&#8217;s well like this pebble.&#8221; Nevertheless the Dhobi refuses
to wash the clothes of some of the lowest castes as the M&#257;ng, Mah&#257;r and Cham&#257;r. Like the Teli the Dhobi is unlucky, and it
is a bad omen to see him when starting on a journey or going out in the morning. But among some of the <a id="d0e13183"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13183">524</a>]</span>higher castes on the occasion of a marriage the elder members of the bridegroom&#8217;s family go with the bride to the Dhobi&#8217;s
house. His wife presents the bride with betel-leaf and in return is given clothes with a rupee. This ceremony is called <i>soh&#257;g</i> or good fortune, and the present from the Dhobin is supposed to be lucky. In Ber&#257;r the Dhobi is also a Bal&#363;ted&#257;r or village
servant. Mr. Kitts writes of him:<a id="d0e13188src" href="#d0e13188" class="noteref">5</a> &#8220;At a wedding he is called upon to spread the clothes on which the bridegroom and his party alight on coming to the bride&#8217;s
house; he also provides the cloth on which the bride and bridegroom are to sit and fastens the <i>kankan</i> (bracelet) on the girl&#8217;s hand. In the Yeotm&#257;l District the barber and the washerman sometimes take the place of the maternal
uncle in the <i>jhenda</i> dance; and when the bridegroom, assisted by five married women, has thrown the necklace of black beads round the bride&#8217;s
neck and has tied it with five knots, the barber and the washerman advance, and lifting the young couple on their thighs dance
to the music of the <i>w&#257;jantri</i>, while the bystanders besprinkle them with red powder.&#8221;

</p>
<p>In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the Dhobis appear to have partly abandoned their hereditary profession and taken to agriculture and other
callings. Sir Benjamin Robertson writes of them:<a id="d0e13204src" href="#d0e13204" class="noteref">6</a> &#8220;The caste largely preponderates in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, a part of the country where, at least to the superficial observer, it would
hardly seem as if its services were much availed of; the number of Dhobis in Raipur and Bil&#257;spur is nearly 40,000. In both
Districts the washerman is one of the recognised village servants, but as a rule he gets no fixed payment, and the great body
of cultivators dispense with his services altogether. According to the <i>Raipur Settlement Report</i> (Mr. Hewett), he is employed by the ryots only to wash the clothes of the dead, and he is never found among a population
of Satn&#257;mis. It may therefore be assumed that in Chhatt&#299;sgarh the Bareth caste has largely taken to cultivation.&#8221; In Bengal
Sir H. Risley states<a id="d0e13212src" href="#d0e13212" class="noteref">7</a> that &#8220;the Dhobi often gives up his caste trade and follows the profession of a writer, messenger or collector of rent (<i>tahs&#299;ld&#257;r</i>), and it is <a id="d0e13219"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13219">525</a>]</span>an old native tradition that a Bengali Dhobi was the first interpreter the English factory at Calcutta had, while it is further
stated that our early commercial transactions were carried on solely through the agency of low-caste natives. The Dhobi, however,
will never engage himself as an indoor servant in the house of a European.&#8221;

<p>Like the other castes who supply the primary needs of the people, the Dhobi is not regarded with much favour by his customers,
and they revenge themselves in various sarcasms at his expense for the injury caused to their clothes by his drastic measures.
The following are mentioned by Sir G. Grierson:<a id="d0e13226src" href="#d0e13226" class="noteref">8</a> &#8216;<i lang="und">Dhobi par Dhobi base, tab kapre par s&#257;bun pare</i>&#8217;, or &#8216;When many Dhobis compete, then some soap gets to the clothes,&#8217; and &#8216;It is only the clothes of the Dhobi&#8217;s father that
never get torn.&#8217; The Dhobi&#8217;s donkey is a familiar sight as one meets him on the road still toiling as in the time of Issachar
between two bundles of clothes each larger than himself, and he has also become proverbial, &#8216;<i lang="und">Dhobi ka gadha neh ghar ka neh gh&#257;t ka</i>,&#8217; &#8216;The Dhobi&#8217;s donkey is always on the move&#8217;; and &#8216;The ass has only one master (a washerman), and the washerman has only
one steed (an ass).&#8217; The resentment felt for the Dhobi by his customers is not confined to his Indian clients, as may be seen
from Eha&#8217;s excellent description of the Dhobi in <i>Behind the Bungalow</i>; and it may perhaps be permissible to introduce here the following short excerpt, though it necessarily loses in force by
being detached from the context: &#8220;Day after day he has stood before that great black stone and wreaked his rage upon shirt
and trouser and coat, and coat and trouser and shirt. Then he has wrung them as if he were wringing the necks of poultry,
and fixed them on his drying line with thorns and spikes, and finally he has taken the battered garments to his torture chamber
and ploughed them with his iron, longwise and crosswise and slantwise, and dropped glowing cinders on their tenderest places.
Son has followed father through countless generations in cultivating this passion for destruction, until it has become the
monstrous growth which we see and shudder at in the Dhobi.&#8221;

<h3>8. Wearing and lending the clothes of customers.</h3>
<p>It is also currently believed that the Dhobi wears the clothes of his customers himself. Thus, &#8216;The Dhobi looks smart in other
people&#8217;s clothes&#8217;; and &#8216;<i lang="und">R&#257;j&#257;che shiri, Parit&#257;che tiri</i>,&#8217; or &#8216;The king&#8217;s headscarf is the washerman&#8217;s loin-cloth.&#8217; On this point Mr. Thurston writes of the Madras washerman: &#8220;It
is an unpleasant reflection that the Vann&#257;ns or washermen add to their income by hiring out the clothes of their customers
for funeral parties, who lay them on the path before the pall-bearers, so that they may not step upon the ground. On one occasion
a party of Europeans, when out shooting near the village of a hill tribe, met a funeral procession on its way to the burial-ground.
The bier was draped in many folds of clean cloth, which one of the party recognised by the initials as one of his bed-sheets.
Another identified as his sheet the cloth on which the corpse was lying. He cut off the corner with the initial, and a few
days later the sheet was returned by the Dhobi, who pretended ignorance of the mutilation, and gave as an explanation that
it must have been done in his absence by one of his assistants.&#8221;<a id="d0e13250src" href="#d0e13250" class="noteref">9</a> And Eha describes the same custom in the following amusing manner: &#8220;Did you ever open your handkerchief with the suspicion
that you had got a duster into your pocket by mistake, till the name of De Souza blazoned on the corner showed you that you
were wearing some one else&#8217;s property? An accident of this kind reveals a beneficent branch of the Dhobi&#8217;s business, one in
which he comes to the relief of needy respectability. Suppose yourself (if you can) to be Mr. Lobo, enjoying the position
of first violinist in a string band which performs at Parsi weddings and on other festive occasions. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>; you cannot evade the necessity for clean shirt-fronts, ill able as your precarious income may be to meet it. In these circumstances
a Dhobi with good connections is what you require. He finds you in shirts of the best quality at so much an evening, and you
are saved all risk and outlay of capital; you need keep no clothes except a greenish-black surtout and pants and an effective
necktie. In this way the wealth of the rich helps the want of the poor without their feeling it or knowing it&#8212;an excellent
arrangement. <a id="d0e13258"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13258">527</a>]</span>Sometimes, unfortunately, Mr. Lobo has a few clothes of his own, and then, as I have hinted, the Dhobi may exchange them by
mistake, for he is uneducated and has much to remember; but if you occasionally suffer in this way you gain in another, for
Mr. Lobo&#8217;s family are skilful with the needle, and I have sent a torn garment to the wash which returned carefully repaired.&#8221;<a id="d0e13260src" href="#d0e13260" class="noteref">10</a>

</span><h2>Dhuri</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13267">
<h3>1. Origin and Subdivisions.</h3>
<p><b>Dhuri.</b><a id="d0e13273src" href="#d0e13273" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;A caste belonging exclusively to Chhatt&#299;sgarh, which numbered 3000 persons in 1911. Dhuri is an honorific abbreviation from
Dhuriya as B&#257;ni from Bania. The special occupation of the caste is rice-parching, and they are an offshoot from Kah&#257;rs, though
in Chhatt&#299;sgarh the Dhuris now consider the Kah&#257;rs as a subcaste of their own. In Bengal the Dhuriyas are a subcaste of the
K&#257;ndus or Bharbh&#363;njas. Sir H. Risley states that &#8220;the Dhurias rank lowest of all the subcastes of K&#257;ndus, owing either to
their having taken up the comparatively menial profession of palanquin-bearing, or to their being a branch of the Kah&#257;r caste
who went in for grain-parching and thus came to be associated with the K&#257;ndus.&#8221;<a id="d0e13276src" href="#d0e13276" class="noteref">2</a> The caste have immigrated to Chhatt&#299;sgarh from the United Provinces. In Kawardha they believe that the R&#257;ja of that State
brought them back with him on his return from a pilgrimage. In Bil&#257;spur and Raipur they say they came from Badh&#257;r, a pargana
in the M&#299;rz&#257;pur District, adjoining Rewah. Badh&#257;r is mentioned in one of the R&#257;jim inscriptions, and is a place remembered
by other castes of Chhatt&#299;sgarh as their ancestral home. The Dhuris of Chhatt&#299;sgarh relate their origin as follows: Mah&#257;deo
went once to the jungle and the damp earth stuck to his feet. He scraped it off and made it into a man, and asked him what
caste he would like to belong to. The man said he would leave it to Mah&#257;deo, who decided that he should be called Dhuri from
<i>dh&#363;r,</i> dust. The man then asked Mah&#257;deo to assign him an occupation, and Mah&#257;deo said that as he was made from dust, which is pounded
earth, his work should <a id="d0e13284"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13284">528</a>]</span>be to prepare <i>cheora</i> or pounded rice, and added as a special distinction that all castes including Br&#257;hmans should eat the pounded rice prepared
by him. All castes do eat <i>cheora</i> because it is not boiled with water. The Dhuris have two subcastes, a higher and a lower, but they are known by different
names in different tracts. In Kawardha they are called R&#257;j Dhuri and Cheor&#257;k&#363;ta, the R&#257;j Dhuris being the descendants of personal
servants in the R&#257;ja&#8217;s family and ranking above the Cheor&#257;k&#363;tas or rice-pounders. In Bil&#257;spur they are called Badh&#257;ria and
Khaw&#257;s, and in Raipur Badh&#257;ria and Desha. The Khaw&#257;s and Desha subcastes do menial household service and rank below the Badh&#257;rias,
who are perhaps later immigrants and refuse to engage in this occupation. The names of their exogamous sections are nearly
all territorial, as Naugahia from Naogaon in Bil&#257;spur District, Agoria from Agori, a pargana in M&#299;rz&#257;pur District, K&#257;shi or
Ben&#257;res, and a number of other names derived from villages in Bil&#257;spur. But the caste do not strictly enforce the rule forbidding
marriage within the <i>gotra</i> or section, and are content with avoiding three generations both on the father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s side. They have probably been
driven to modify the rule on account of the paucity of their numbers and the difficulty of arranging marriages. For the same
reason perhaps they look with indulgence on the practice, as a rule strictly prohibited, of marriage with a woman of another
caste of lower social rank, and will admit the children of such a marriage into the caste, though not the woman herself.

<div class="div2" id="d0e13295">
<h3>2. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Infant-marriage is in vogue, and polygamy is permitted only if the first wife be barren. The betrothal is cemented by an exchange
of betel-leaves and areca-nuts between the fathers of the engaged couple. A bride-price of from ten to twenty rupees is usually
paid. Some rice, a pice coin, 21 cowries and 21 pieces of turmeric are placed in the hole in which the marriage post is erected.
When the wedding procession arrives at the girl&#8217;s house the bridegroom goes to the marriage-shed and pulls out the festoons
of mango leaves, the bride&#8217;s family trying to prevent him by offering him a winnowing-fan. He then approaches the door of
the house, behind which his future mother-in-law is standing, <a id="d0e13300"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13300">529</a>]</span>and slips a piece of cloth through the door for her. She takes this and retires without being seen. The wedding consists of
the <i>bh&#257;nwar</i> ceremony or walking round the sacred pole. During the proceedings the women tie a new thread round the bridegroom&#8217;s neck
to avert the evil eye. After the wedding the bride and bridegroom, in opposition to the usual custom, must return to the latter&#8217;s
house on foot. In explanation of this they tell a story to the effect that the married couple were formerly carried in a palanquin.
But on one occasion when a wedding procession came to a river, everybody began to catch fish, leaving the bride deserted,
and the palanquin-bearers, seeing this, carried her off. To prevent the recurrence of such a mischance the couple now have
to walk. Widow-marriage is permitted, and the widow usually marries her late husband&#8217;s younger brother. Divorce is only permitted
for misconduct on the part of the wife.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13305">
<h3>3. Religious beliefs.</h3>
<p>The Dhuris principally worship the goddess Devi. Nearly all members of the caste belong to the Kab&#299;rpanthi sect. They believe
that the sun on setting goes through the earth, and that the milky way is the path by which the elephant of the heavens passes
from south to north to feed on the young bamboo shoots, of which he is very fond. They think that the constellation of the
Great Bear is a cot with three thieves tied to it. The thieves came to steal the cot, which belonged to an old woman, but
God caught them and tied them down there for ever. Orion is the plough left by one of the P&#257;ndava brothers after he had finished
tilling the heavens. The dead are burnt. They observe mourning during nine or ten days for an adult and make libations to
the dead at the usual period in the month of Kunw&#257;r (September-October).


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13310">
<h3>4. Occupation and social status.</h3>
<p>The proper occupation of the caste is to parch rice. The rice is husked and then parched in an earthen pan, and subsequently
bruised with a mallet in a wooden mortar. When prepared in this manner it is called <i>cheora</i>. The Dhuris also act as <i>khidmatg&#257;rs</i> or household servants, but the members of the Badharia subcaste refuse to do this work. Some members of the caste are fishermen,
and others grow melons and sweet potatoes. Considering that they <a id="d0e13321"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13321">530</a>]</span>live in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, the caste are somewhat scrupulous in the matter of food, neither eating fowls nor drinking liquor. The
Kawardha Dhuris, however, who are later immigrants than the others, do not observe these restrictions, the reason for which
may be that the Dhuris think it necessary to be strict in the matter of food, so that no one may object to take parched rice
from them. R&#257;wats and Gonds take food from their hands in some places, and their social status in Chhatt&#299;sgarh is about equivalent
to that of the R&#257;wats or Ah&#299;rs. A man of the caste who kills a cow or gets vermin in a wound must go to Am&#257;rkantak to bathe
in the Nerbudda.

</span><h2>Dum&#257;l</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13326">
<h3>1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
<p><b>Dum&#257;l.</b><a id="d0e13332src" href="#d0e13332" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;An agricultural caste found in the Uriya country and principally in the Sonpur State, recently transferred to Bih&#257;r and Orissa.
In 1901, 41,000 Dum&#257;ls were enumerated in the Central Provinces, but only a few persons now remain. The caste originally came
from Orissa. They themselves say that they were formerly a branch of the Gaurs, with whom they now have no special connection.
They derive their name from a village called Dumba Hadap in the Athm&#257;lik State, where they say that they lived. Another story
is that Dum&#257;l is derived from Duma, the name of a gateway in Baud town, near which they dwelt. Sir H. Risley says: &#8220;The Dum&#257;ls
or J&#257;dupuria Gaura seem to be a group of local formation. They cherish the tradition that their ancestors came to Orissa from
J&#257;dupur, but this appears to be nothing more than the name of the J&#257;davas or Y&#257;davas, the mythical progenitors of the Goala
caste transformed into the name of an imaginary town.&#8221;


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13335">
<h3>2. Subdivisions.</h3>
<p>The Dum&#257;ls have no subcastes, but they have a complicated system of exogamy. This includes three kinds of divisions or sections,
the <i>got</i> or sept, the <i>barga</i> or family title and the <i>mitti</i> or earth from which they sprang, that is, the name of the original village of the clan. Marriage is prohibited only between
persons who have the same <i>got</i>, <i>barga</i> and <i>mitti</i>; if any one of these is different it is allowed. Thus a man of the N&#257;g <i>got</i>, Padh&#257;n <i>barga</i> and Hindolsai <i>mitti</i> may marry a girl of the N&#257;g <i>got</i>, Padh&#257;n <i>barga</i> and <a id="d0e13373"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13373">531</a>]</span>Kandhpad&#257; <i>mitti</i>; or one of the N&#257;g <i>got</i>, Karmi <i>barga</i> and Hindolsai <i>mitti</i>; or one of the Bud <i>got</i>, Padh&#257;n <i>barga</i> and Hindolsai <i>mitti</i>. The <i>bargas</i> are very numerous, but the <i>gots</i> and <i>mittis</i> are few and common to many <i>bargas</i>; and many people have forgotten the name of their <i>mitti</i> altogether. Marriage therefore usually depends on the <i>bargas</i> being different. The following table shows the <i>got</i>, <i>barga</i> and <i>mitti</i> of a few families:

</p>
<p>The only other <i>gots</i> besides those given above are Kachhap (tortoise), Ul&#363;k (owl) and Limb (<i>nim</i>-tree). The <i>gots</i> are thus totemistic, and the animal or plant giving its name to the <i>got</i> is venerated and worshipped. The names of <i>bargas</i> are diverse. Some are titles indicating the position of the founder of the family in life, as N&#257;ik (leader), Padh&#257;n (chief),
Karmi (manager), Mah&#257;kul (great family) and so on. Others are derived from functions performed in sacrifices, as Am&#257;yat (one
who kills the animal in the sacrifice), Gurandi (one who makes a preparation of sugar for it), Dehri (priest), B&#257;rik (one
who carries the god&#8217;s umbrella), Kamp (one who is in charge of the baskets containing the sacred articles of the temple).
Another set of <i>bargas</i> are names signifying the performance of menial functions in household service, as Gejo (kitchen-cleaner), Chaulia (rice-cleaner),
Gadua (<i>lot&#257;</i>-bearer), D&#257;ng (spoon-bearer), Ghusri (cleaner of the dining-place with cowdung). Other names of <i>bargas</i> are derived from the caste&#8217;s traditional occupation of grazing cattle, as Mesua or Mendli (shepherd), Gaigariya (milkman),
Chh&#257;nd (one who ties a rope to the legs of a cow when milking her). These names are interesting as showing that the Dum&#257;ls
<a id="d0e13531"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13531">532</a>]</span>before taking to their present occupation of agriculture were temple servants, household menials and cattle-herds, thus fulfilling
the functions now performed by the R&#257;wat or Gaur caste of graziers in Sambalpur. The names of the <i>mittis</i> or villages show that their original home was in the Orissa Tributary Mah&#257;ls, while the totemistic names of <i>gots</i> indicate their Dravidian origin. The marriage of first cousins is prohibited.

<div class="div2" id="d0e13539">
<h3>3. Marriage.</h3>
<p>Girls must be married before adolescence, and in the event of the parents failing to accomplish this, the following heavy
penalty is imposed on the girl herself. She is taken to the forest and tied to a tree with thread, this proceeding signifying
her permanent exclusion from the caste. Any one belonging to another caste can then take her away and marry her if he chooses
to do so. In practice, however, this penalty is very rarely imposed, as the parents can get out of it by marrying her to an
old man, whether he is already married or not, the parents bearing all the expenses, while the husband gives two to four annas
as a nominal contribution. After the marriage the old man can either keep the girl as his wife or divorce her for a further
nominal payment of eight annas to a rupee. She then becomes a widow and can marry again, while her parents will get ten or
twenty rupees for her.

</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s father makes the proposal for the marriage according to the following curious formula. Taking some fried grain he
goes to the house of the father of the bride and addresses him as follows in the presence of the neighbours and the relatives
of both parties: &#8220;I hear that the tree has budded and a blossom has come out; I intend to pluck it.&#8221; To which the girl&#8217;s father
replies: &#8220;The flower is delicate; it is in the midst of an ocean and very difficult to approach: how will you pluck it?&#8221; To
which the reply is: &#8216;I shall bring ships and <i>dongas</i> (boats) and ply them in the ocean and fetch the flower.&#8217; And again: &#8220;If you do pluck it, can you support it? Many difficulties
may stand in the way, and the flower may wither or get lost; will it be possible for you to steer the flower&#8217;s boat in the
ocean of time, as long as it is destined to be in this world?&#8221; To which the answer is: &#8216;Yes, I shall, and it is with that
<a id="d0e13549"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13549">533</a>]</span>intention that I have come to you.&#8217; On which the girl&#8217;s father finally says: &#8216;Very well then, I have given you the flower.&#8217;
The question of the bride&#8217;s price is then discussed. There are three recognised scales&#8212;Rs. 7 and 7 pieces of cloth, Rs. 9
and 9 pieces of cloth, and Rs. 18 and 18 pieces of cloth. The rupees in question are those of Orissa, and each of them is
worth only two-thirds of a Government rupee. In cases of extreme poverty Rs. 2 and 2 pieces of cloth are accepted. The price
being fixed, the boy&#8217;s father goes to pay it after an interval; and on this occasion he holds out his cloth, and a cocoanut
is placed on it and broken by the girl&#8217;s father, which confirms the betrothal. Before the marriage seven married girls go
out and dig earth after worshipping the ground, and on their return let it all fall on to the head of the bridegroom&#8217;s mother,
which is protected only by a cloth. On the next day offerings are made to the ancestors, who are invited to attend the ceremony
as village gods. The bridegroom is shaved clean and bathed, and the Br&#257;hman then ties an iron ring to his wrist, and the barber
puts the turban and marriage-crown on his head. The procession then starts, but any barber who meets it on the way may put
a fresh marriage-crown on the bridegroom&#8217;s head and receive eight annas or a rupee for it, so that he sometimes arrives at
his destination wearing four or five of them. The usual ceremonies attend the arrival. At the marriage the couple are blindfolded
and seated in the shed, while the Br&#257;hman priest repeats <i>mantras</i> or verses, and during this time the parents and the parties must continue placing nuts and pice all over the shed. These
are the perquisites of the Br&#257;hman. The hands of the couple are then tied together with <i>kusha</i> grass (<i>Eragrostis cynosuroides</i>), and water is poured over them. After the ceremony the couple gamble with seven cowries and seven pieces of turmeric. The
boy then presses a cowrie on the ground with his little finger, and the girl has to take it away, which she easily does. The
girl in her turn holds a cowrie inside her clenched hand, and the boy has to remove it with his little finger, which he finds
it impossible to do. Thus the boy always loses and has to promise the girl something, either to give her an ornament or to
take her on a pilgrimage, or to <a id="d0e13560"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13560">534</a>]</span>make her the mistress of his house. On the fifth or last day of the ceremony some curds are placed in a small pot, and the
couple are made to churn them; this is probably symbolical of the caste&#8217;s original occupation of tending cattle. The bride
goes to her husband&#8217;s house for three days, and then returns home. When she is to be finally brought to her husband&#8217;s house,
his father with some relatives goes to the parents of the girl and asks for her. It is now strict etiquette for her father
to refuse to send her on the first occasion, and they usually have to call on him three or four times at intervals of some
days, and selecting the days given by the astrologer as auspicious. Occasionally they have to go as many as ten times; but
finally, if the girl&#8217;s father proves very troublesome, they send an old woman who drags away the girl by force. If the father
sends her away willingly he gives her presents of several basket-loads of grain, oil, turmeric, cooking-pots, cloth, and if
he is well off a cow and bullocks, the value of the presents amounting to about Rs. 50. The girl&#8217;s brother takes her to her
husband&#8217;s house, where a repetition of the marriage ceremony on a small scale is performed. Twice again after the consummation
of the marriage she visits her parents for periods of one and six months, but after this she never again goes to their house
unaccompanied by her husband. Widow-marriage is allowed, and the widow may marry the younger brother of her late husband or
not as she pleases. But if she marries another man he must pay a sum of Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 for her, of which Rs. 5 go to the
Panua or headman of the caste, and Rs. 2 to their tutelary goddess Parmeshwari. The children by the first husband are kept
either by his relatives or the widow&#8217;s parents, and do not go to the new husband. When a bachelor marries a widow, he is first
married to a flower or <i>sahara </i>tree. A widow who has remarried cannot take part in any worship or marriage ceremony in her house, not even in the marriage
of her own sons. Divorce is allowed, and is effected in the presence of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee. A divorced woman may marry again.

</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13568">
<h3>4. Religious and social customs.</h3>
<p>The caste worship the goddess Parmeshwari, the wife of Vishnu, and Jagann&#257;th, the Uriya incarnation of Vishnu. Parmeshwari
is worshipped by Br&#257;hmans, who offer bread <a id="d0e13573"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13573">535</a>]</span>and <i>kh&#299;r</i> or rice and milk to her; goats are also offered by the Dehri or Mah&#257;kul, the caste priest, who receives the heads of the
goats as his remuneration. They believe in witches, who they think drink the blood of children, and employ sorcerers to exorcise
them. They worship a stick on Dasahra day in remembrance of their old profession of herding cattle, and they worship cows
and buffaloes at the full moon of Shr&#257;wan (July-August). During Kunw&#257;r, on the eighth day of each fortnight, two festivals
are held. At the first each girl in the family wears a thread containing eighteen knots twisted three times round her neck.
All the girls fast and receive presents of cloths and grain from their brothers. This is called Bhaijiuntia, or the ceremony
for the welfare of the brothers. On the second day the mother of the family does the same, and receives presents from her
sons, this being Pu&#257;jiuntia, or the ceremony for the welfare of sons. The Dum&#257;ls believe that in the beginning water covered
the earth. They think that the sun and moon are the eyes of God, and that the stars are the souls of virtuous men, who enjoy
felicity in heaven for the period measured by the sum of their virtuous actions, and when this has expired have to descend
again to earth to suffer the agonies of human life. When a shooting star is seen they think it is the soul of one of these
descending to be born again on earth. They both burn and bury their dead according to their means. After a body is buried
they make a fire over the grave and place an empty pot on it. Mourning is observed for twelve days in the case of a married
and for seven in the case of an unmarried person. Children dying when less than six days old are not mourned at all. During
mourning the persons of the household do not cook for themselves. On the third day after the death three leaf-plates, each
containing a little rice, sugar and butter, are offered to the spirit of the deceased. On the fourth day four such plates
are offered, and on the fifth day five, and so on up to the ninth day when the Pindas or sacrificial cakes are offered, and
nine persons belonging to the caste are invited, food and a new piece of cloth being given to each. Should only one attend,
nine plates of food would be served to him, and he would be given nine pieces of <a id="d0e13578"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13578">536</a>]</span>cloth. If two or more persons in a family are killed by a tiger, a Sulia or magician is called in, and he pretends to be the
tiger and to bite some one in the family, who is then carried as a corpse to the burial-place, buried for a short time and
taken out again. All the ceremonies of mourning are observed for him for one day. This proceeding is believed to secure immunity
for the family from further attacks. In return for his services the Sulia gets a share of everything in the house corresponding
to what he would receive, supposing he were a member of the family, on a partition. Thus if the family consisted of only two
persons he would get a third part of the whole property.

</p>
<p>The Dum&#257;ls eat meat, including wild boar&#8217;s flesh, but not beef, fowls or tame pigs. They do not drink liquor. They will take
food cooked with water from Br&#257;hmans and Sudhs, and even the leavings of food from Br&#257;hmans. This is probably because they
were formerly the household servants of Br&#257;hmans, though they have now risen somewhat in position and rank, together with
the Koltas and Sudhs, as a good cultivating caste. Their women and girls can easily be distinguished, the girls because the
hair is shaved until they are married, and the women because they wear bangles of glass on one arm and of lac on the other.
They never wear nose-rings or the ornament called <i>pairi</i> on the feet, and no ornaments are worn on the arm above the elbow<span id="d0e13585" class="corr" title="Source: ">.</span> They do not wear black clothing. The women are tattooed on the hands, feet and breast. Morality within the caste is lax.
A woman going wrong with a man of her own caste is not punished, because the Dum&#257;ls live generally in Native States, where
it is the business of the R&#257;ja to find the seducer. But she is permanently excommunicated for a <i>liaison</i> with a man of another caste. Eating with a very low caste is almost the only offence which entails permanent exclusion for
both sexes. The Dum&#257;ls have a bad reputation for fidelity, according to a saying: &#8216;You cannot call the jungle a plain, and
you should not call the Dum&#257;l a brother,&#8217; that is, do not trust a Dum&#257;l. Like the Ah&#299;rs they are somewhat stupid, and when
enquiry was being made from them as to what crops they did not grow, one of them replied that they did not sow salt. They
are <a id="d0e13591"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13591">537</a>]</span>good cultivators, and will grow anything except hemp and turmeric. In some places they still follow their traditional occupation
of grazing cattle.

</span><h2>Fak&#299;r</h2>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13596">
<h3>1. General notice.</h3>
<p><b>Fak&#299;r.</b><a id="d0e13602src" href="#d0e13602" class="noteref">1</a>&#8212;The class of Muhammadan beggars. In the Central Provinces the name is practically confined to Muhammadans, but in Upper India
Hindus also use it. Nearly 9000 Fak&#299;rs were returned in 1911, being residents mainly of Districts with large towns, as Jubbulpore,
N&#257;gpur and Amraoti. Nearly two-fifths of the Muhammadans of the Central Provinces live in towns, and Muhammadan beggars would
naturally congregate there also. The name is derived from the Arabic <i>fakr</i>, poverty. The Fak&#299;rs are often known as Sh&#257;h, Lord, or Sain, a corruption of the Sanskrit Sw&#257;mi, master. Muhammad did not
recognise religious ascetism, and expressly discouraged it. But even during his lifetime his companions Abu Bakr and Ali established
religious orders with Zikrs or special exercises, and all Muhammadan Fak&#299;rs trace their origin to Abu Bakr or Ali subsequently
the first and fourth Caliphs.<a id="d0e13620src" href="#d0e13620" class="noteref">2</a> The Fak&#299;rs are divided into two classes, the Ba Shara or those who live according to the rules of Islam and marry; and the
Be Shara or those without the law. These latter have no wives or homes; they drink intoxicating liquor, and neither fast,
pray nor rule their passions. But several of the orders contain both married and celibate groups.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13623">
<h3>2. Principal orders.</h3>
<p>The principal classes of Fak&#299;rs in the Central Provinces are the Madari, Gurujw&#257;le or Rafai, Jal&#257;li, Mew&#257;ti, Sada Soh&#257;gal
and Nakshbandia. All of these except the Nakshbandia are nominally at least Be Shara, or without the law, and celibate.

</p>
<p>The Madari are the followers of one Madar Sh&#257;h, a converted Jew of Aleppo, whose tomb is supposed to be at Makhanpur in the
United Provinces. Their characteristic badge is a pair of pincers. Some, in order to force people to give them alms, go about
dragging a chain or lashing their legs with a whip. Others are monkey- and bear-trainers <a id="d0e13630"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13630">538</a>]</span>and rope-dancers. The Madaris are said to be proof against snakes and scorpions, and to have power to cure their bites. They
will leap into a fire and trample it down, crying out, &#8216;<i lang="und">Aam Madar, Aam Madar</i>.&#8217;<a id="d0e13635src" href="#d0e13635" class="noteref">3</a>


</p>
<div id="d0e13640" class="figure"><img border="0" src="images/p538.jpg" alt="Group of Gurujw&#257;le Fak&#299;rs." width="720" height="402"><p class="figureHead">Group of Gurujw&#257;le Fak&#299;rs.</p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p>The Gurujw&#257;le or Rafai have as their badge a spiked iron club with small chains attached to the end. The Fak&#299;r rattles the
chains of his club to announce his presence, and if the people will not give him alms strikes at his own cheek or eye with
the sharp point of his club, making the blood flow. They make prayers to their club once a year, so that it may not cause
them serious injury when they strike themselves with it.

</p>
<p>The Jal&#257;lias are named after their founder, Jal&#257;l-ud-d&#299;n of Bokh&#257;ra, and have a horse-whip as their badge, with which they
sometimes strike themselves on the hands and feet. They are said to consume large quantities of <i>bh&#257;ng</i>, and to eat snakes and scorpions; they shave all the hair on the head and face, including the eyebrows, except a small scalp-lock
on the right side.

</p>
<p>The Mew&#257;ti appear to be a thieving order. They are also known as Kulchor or thieves of the family, and appear to have been
originally a branch of the Madari, who were perhaps expelled on account of their thieving habits. Their distinguishing mark
is a double bag like a pack-saddle, which they hang over their shoulders. The Sada or M&#363;sa Soh&#257;g are an order who dress like
women, put on glass bangles, have their ears and noses pierced for ornaments, and wear long hair, but retain their beards
and moustaches. They regard themselves as brides of God or of Hussan, and beg in this guise.

</p>
<p>The Nakshbandia are the disciples of Khwaja M&#299;r Muhammad, who was called Nakshband or brocade-maker. They beg at night-time,
carrying an open brass lamp with a short wick. Children are fond of the Nakshband, and go out in numbers to give him money.
In return he marks them on the brow with oil from his lamp. They are quiet and well behaved, belonging to the Ba Shara class
of Fak&#299;rs, and having homes and families.

</p>
<p>The Kalandaria or wandering dervishes, who are <a id="d0e13657"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13657">539</a>]</span>occasionally met with, were founded by Kalandar Yusuf-ul-Andalusi, a native of Spain. Having been dismissed from another order,
he founded this as a new one, with the obligation of perpetual travelling. The Kalandar is a well-known figure in Eastern
stories.<a id="d0e13659src" href="#d0e13659" class="noteref">4</a>

</p>
<p>The Maulawiyah are the well-known dancing dervishes of Constantinople and Cairo, but do not belong to India.

</p>
<p>The different orders of Fak&#299;rs are not strictly endogamous, and marriages can take place between their members, though the
Madaris prefer to confine marriage to their own order. Fak&#299;rs as a body are believed to marry among themselves, and hence
to form something in the nature of a caste, but they freely admit outsiders, whether Muhammadans or proselytised Hindus.


</p>
</div>
<div class="div2" id="d0e13669">
<h3>3. Rules and customs.</h3>
<p>Every Fak&#299;r must have a Murshid or preceptor, and be initiated by him. This applies also to boys born in the order, and a
father cannot initiate his son. The rite is usually simple, the novice having to drink sherbet from the same cup as his preceptor
and make him a present of Rs. 1&#8211;4; but some orders insist that the whole body of a novice should be shaved clean of hair before
he is initiated. The principal religious exercise of Fak&#299;rs is known as Zikr, and consists in the continual repetition of
the names of God by various methods, it being supposed that they can draw the name from different parts of the body. The exercise
is so exhausting that they frequently faint under it, and is varied by repetition of certain chapters of the Kor&#257;n. The Fak&#299;r
has a <i>tasb&#299;h</i> or rosary, often consisting of ninety-nine beads, on which he repeats the ninety-nine names of God. The Fak&#299;rs beg both from
Hindus and Muhammadans, and are sometimes troublesome and importunate, inflicting wounds on themselves as a means of extorting
alms. One beggar in Saugor said that he would give every one who gave him alms five strokes with his whip, and attracted considerable
custom by this novel expedient. Some of them are in charge of Muhammadan cemeteries and receive fees for a burial, while others
live at the tombs of saints. They keep the tomb in good repair, cover it with a green cloth and keep a lighted lamp on it,
and appropriate the <a id="d0e13677"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e13677">540</a>]</span>offerings made by visitors. Owing to their solitude and continuous repetition of prayers many Fak&#299;rs fall into a distraught
condition, when they are known as <i>mast</i>, and are believed to be possessed of a spirit. At such a time the people attach the greatest importance to any utterances
which fall from the Fak&#299;r&#8217;s lips, believing that he has the gift of prophecy, and follow him about with presents to induce
him to make some utterance.
